Sympathetic activation appears to accelerate the development of atherosclerosis  an effect that may be inhibited by beta-receptor blockade. It is unclear  however  which mechanisms mediate this effect. In view of the significance attached to endothelial injury in the initial phases of atherogenesis  we decided to test whether sympathetic activation might lead to an increase in endothelial injury. Chloralose anesthesia was used to induce sympathetic activation and the presence of intracellular IgG as a criterion of endothelial cell injury. The beta 1-selective beta-blocker metoprolol was used to evaluate if the effect s  of sympathetic activation might be mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors. In normal rabbits  the frequency of injured endothelial cells in unbranched areas of the thoracic aorta was 0.23   compared with 1.93  in circumostial areas. Chloralose anesthesia caused significant increases in blood pressure  heart rate  and plasma norepinephrine  that is  caused sympathetic activation  and led to an approximately fivefold increase in the number of injured cells both in unbranched and in circumostial areas. This increase was totally inhibited by metoprolol pretreatment  indicating that it was mediated by beta 1-receptors. These observations suggest one possible mechanism that may connect sympathetic activation with atherogenesis and explain why beta-blockade protects against atherosclerosis. Pettersson K  Bejne B  Bjork H  Strawn WB  Bondjers G.Myocyte cell loss and myocyte cellular hyperplasia in the hypertrophied aging rat heart. To determine the effects of age on the myocardium  the functional and structural characteristics of the heart were studied in rats at 4  12  20  and 29 months of age. Mean arterial pressure  left ventricular pressure and its first derivative  dP dt   and heart rate were comparable in rat groups up to 20 months. During the interval from 20 to 29 months  elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreased dP dt indicated that a significant impairment of ventricular function occurred with senescence. In the period between 4 and 12 months  a reduction of nearly 19  in the total number of myocytes was measured in both ventricles. In the subsequent ages  similar decreases in myocyte cell number were found in the left ventricle  whereas in the right ventricle  the initial loss was fully reversed by 20 months. Moreover  from 20 to 29 months  a 59  increase in the aggregate number of myocytes occurred in the right ventricular myocardium. In the left ventricle  a 3  increment was also seen  but this small change was not statistically significant. These estimations of myocyte cellular hyperplasia  however  were complicated by the fact that cell loss continued to take place with age. The volume fraction of collagen in the tissue  in fact  progressively increased from 8  and 7  at 4 months to 16  and 22  at 29 months in the left and right ventricles  respectively. In conclusion  myocyte cellular hyperplasia tends to regenerate the ventricular mass being lost with age in the adult mammalian rat heart.

The authors assessed absorption and motility of the human ileum after a prolonged period of disuse. In eight patients with ulcerative colitis  a manometric-catheter assembly was placed via the ileostomy into the unused portion of distal ileum two months after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and temporary diverting loop ileostomy. The distal ileum was perfused at 5 ml min with an isosmotic solution of either sodium chloride or ileal chyme diluted with sodium chloride for three hours before and three hours after a meal on two consecutive days. Absorption was measured  single and clustered pressure waves were identified and quantitated with the aid of a computer program  and a motility index was calculated. Mean absorption   - S.E.M. of both perfusates was poor on day 1  -10   - 2 ml 25 cm x 30 min   and the meal induced no ileal motor response. By day 2  however  absorption of both perfusates was much improved  -1   - 2 ml 25 cm x 30 min  P less than 0.05   and the number of discrete clustered contractions and the motility index now clearly increased after the meal  2.6   - 0.6 vs. 7.2   - 1.0 clustered waves hr  7.5   - 0.5 vs. 9.7   - 0.2 motility units 30 min  P less than 0.05 . The conclusion was that absorption and motility of the human ileum were impaired after two months of disuse  but that ileal absorption and motility improved one day after the introduction of isosmotic ileal perfusates. Miedema BW  Karlstrom L  Hanson RB  Johnson GP  Kelly KA.Evolution of fundic argyrophil cell hyperplasia in nonantral atrophic gastritis. Fundic argyrophil cells were studied for a mean period of 68.7 months  range  11-170  in 18 patients with fundic atrophic gastritis and achlorhydria. Initially  12 patients had hyperplasia of the argyrophil cells  the severity of which was assessed using a semiquantitative classification based on the number of argyrophil clusters per square millimeter. At the end of the study  the degree of hyperplasia was unchanged in 9 patients  had decreased in 2  and had increased in 1  no significant increase in the number of argyrophil clusters  precarcinoid changes  or carcinoid tumors were observed and the high level of gastrinemia  mean  4.8  range  1.9-8.1  times the upper limit for normal  did not change significantly. Of the 6 patients with no hyperplasia at the outset of the study  4 continued without hyperplasia and 2 presented a low-grade hyperplasia at the 20th and 130th month. Gastrinemia increased significantly in the last patient and stayed normal in the other 5. This study argues in favor of the stable appearance of fundic argyrophil cells in patients with atrophic gastritis and stable gastrinemia. Roucayrol AM  Cattan D.Late recurrence of a hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient with incomplete Alagille syndrome. In this study  the case of a patient presenting a second hepatocellular carcinoma 13 years after resection of a first tumor of the same type is reported. In this case  etiological investigations remained negative  but an incomplete form of syndromatic Alagille syndrome with paucity of bile ducts in the nontumoral tissue was detected and associated with nodular regenerative hyperplasia and foci of dysplasia. Malignant transformation in Alagille syndrome seems to be extremely rare. The fact that such tumors evolve very slowly could be an argument for partial hepatectomy and  if necessary  liver transplantation.

Cholangiographic changes of the biliary system in 16 patients with proven hepatic clonorchiasis  diagnosed by positive stool or bile ova isolates  were studied. All patients presented with epigastric pain. Other symptoms included jaundice in 31   5 of 16  and fever in 12.5   2 of 16 . Praziquantel given at 25 mg kg for three doses in 1 day were administered. Three consecutive stool tests were performed 3 months after treatment and were negative in 87.5   14 of 16 . ERCP studies were repeated at a mean interval of 31.6 months  range  8 to 69 months . Measurements of the bile ducts on retrograde cholangiograms before and after treatment were compared using the paired Student s t test. Filling defects and blunting of the terminal bile ducts seen on the initial cholangiogram  interpreted as the presence of adult worms  disappeared after treatment. However  there was no significant change between pre- and post-treatment measurement of bile duct caliber. Bile duct dilation  irregularities  and ductal proliferation persisted despite eradication of the parasite.

A dual laser system capable of distinguishing atherosclerotic plaque from components of normal arterial wall was used to deliver laser energy to cut a channel through occluded vessels. This system was used to facilitate balloon angioplasty of short  3-17 cm  total occlusions of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries in 17 patients. In 10 patients the occluding lesion was traversed by the laser wire and patency was effectively restored by balloon angioplasty. Satisfactory luminal patency has persisted for 2 to 12 months  mean 6 months  in 9 cases  the lesion in the tenth patient restenosed at 3 months. The laser procedure was unsuccessful in all 3 cases with occlusions over 10 cm and in 4 others. There were no clinically important complications. This experience suggests that most patients who presently require interventional treatment can be managed by standard angioplasty methods and or require a bypass operation. The  Smart  laser is safe and effective short-term in facilitating angioplasty in some patients in whom standard angioplasty techniques are not feasible. The implications of these findings are discussed.

Dental technology and delivery of care constantly improve. At the same time  certain folk traditions and attitudes towards dentistry remain curiously constant. Dental extraction using string is an enduring amateur technique  images of which are still widely perpetuated among the laity  in western society. The historical development of extraction as a treatment modality and the rise of dentistry are discussed in relation to the patient s view of dental therapy. Various examples from art and literature are introduced to give depth and perspective to current popular perceptions. Extraction with string is presented as a metaphor for all extractions and as reflective of the public s continuing psychological sensitivity to surgical intervention in the oral cavity. Curtis EK.Detection of human papillomavirus-genomic DNA in oral epithelial dysplasias  oral smokeless tobacco-associated leukoplakias  and epithelial malignancies. Human papillomavirus  HPV  is an infectious agent that is increasingly associated with mucosal cancers  in particular cancer of the cervix. The present investigation was undertaken in an attempt to determine whether HPV could be easily detected in biopsies of oral tissues  specifically oral squamous cell carcinomas  oral epithelial dysplasias  smokeless tobacco keratoses  verrucous hyperplasia  and verrucous carcinoma. In situ DNA hybridization methods were used to isolate specific HPV genomes. Among 100 instances of benign leukoplakia  only 4  of non-tobacco-related and 10  of smokeless tobacco-related lesions harbored viral sequences. We were able to detect viral sequences in dysplastic lesions 3  of the time. Alternatively  17  and 20  of the verrucous hyperplasias and verrucous carcinomas were positive for viral nucleic acids. Six percent of the squamous cell carcinomas harbored HPV. On the basis of these findings  it is concluded that HPV of known genotype can be identified in oral premalignant and malignant neoplasms. Greer RO Jr  Eversole LR  Crosby LK.Blunt trauma in adults and children  a comparative analysis. Trauma remains the major cause of death in children and young adults. Adult and pediatric patients differ significantly in both mechanism of and physiologic response to injury. We reviewed the records of all consecutive adult and pediatric blunt trauma patients admitted to a major metropolitan trauma center for a 10-year period. An extensive computerized database has been maintained for all patients since 1977. A comparative statistical analysis of mechanism of injury  specific organ injury  and clinical outcome was performed. Altogether  1 722 adults and 289 children were treated during the study period. Blunt trauma accounted for 82.8  of adult and 94.3  of pediatric injury  p   0.00005   and only these patients were considered for analysis. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage was performed in 249 children and 1 464 adults  with a respective accuracy of 99.6  and 97.2 . Mechanism of injury was comparable for both groups  although children were far more likely to be injured by falls  bicycle accidents  or struck by an automobile. Comparative analysis of specific injuries demonstrated significantly fewer pediatric chest  p   0.001   spine  p   0.03   and pelvic  p   0.003  injuries. Central nervous system  CNS  injury in children was a strong determinant of outcome  serious pediatric CNS trauma was associated with a tenfold increase in mortality. Mortality for children in the absence of CNS injury was less than 3 . Spinal injury also appeared to be a predictor of poor outcome in the pediatric population  with an associated mortality of greater than 50 . Overall  survival was age independent  82.5  of adults and 85.8  of children were survivors. ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS  Snyder CL  Jain VN  Saltzman DA  Strate RG  Perry JF Jr  Leonard AS.Clinicopathological features of elevated lesions of the duodenal bulb. We present here our findings on patients with an elevated lesion of the duodenal bulb. All these patients were treated in our clinics between the years 1984 and 1988. These lesions were present in 36 of 8 802 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal pan-endoscopy. Two patients had a duodenal carcinoma  2 an adenoma  and 1 a Brunner s gland adenoma. There were 15 with a hyperplastic polyp  3 with a heterogenic gastric mucosa  3 with Brunner s gland hyperplasia  6 with duodenitis  and 4 with regenerative mucosa. Among these 36 lesions  only 69   25 lesions  were evident on the upper gastrointestinal X-ray series. Adenoma and Brunner s gland adenoma were of a pedunculated form of the gross type and had an irregular surface mucosa. Both duodenal carcinomas were detected by endoscopic biopsy and were resected. Histologically  these lesions were limited to the submucosal layer and were of the non-pedunculated polypoid form  but there were no other characteristic endoscopic features  in comparison with other elevated lesions. Thus  upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with routine observations of the duodenal bulb plus endoscopic biopsy will lead to a definite diagnosis of these elevated lesions and to the early detection and treatment of this rare malignant lesion.

This study was designed to evaluate changes in the perinatal autopsy following the adoption of a new autopsy protocol. The University of Utah Medical Center has a Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team composed of obstetricians  pediatricians  geneticists  and other health care professionals. These individuals are involved in the care of patients whose pregnancies are at risk for congenital malformations. An autopsy protocol was designed to increase the interaction of the pathologist with the Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team in the evaluation of perinatal death. Two years  1982 and 1987  before and after the protocol was implemented  were selected for retrospective review. The autopsies in 1987 made more specific diagnoses compared with those in 1982. Additional congenital anomalies were diagnosed  and increased numbers of patients were found to have well-described congenital disorders. The number of attempted postnatal autopsy chromosome studies increased and more chromosomal abnormalities were detected. The final autopsy diagnoses made in 1987 have provided more information to the physician for genetic or other patient counseling. After the protocol was adopted  increased numbers of cases were referred to the Medical Center for evaluation at autopsy. More of those who came to autopsy had been evaluated during life by members of the Prenatal Diagnosis Conference Team. Premortem sonograms had been done at an earlier gestational age and a greater number of anomalies were detected. Fewer of the fetuses had intrauterine death and more had pregnancy terminated by induction of labor. The gestational age at delivery declined. Craven CM  Dempsey S  Carey JC  Kochenour NK.Hyperthecosis of the ovaries in a woman with a placental site trophoblastic tumor. Rapidly increasing testosterone levels were observed in a patient presenting with sudden onset of virilization. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a placental site trophoblastic tumor in the uterus. Wedge biopsies of the ovaries showed extensive luteinization of the ovarian stroma in both ovaries. Concentrations of testosterone  dihydrotestosterone  and androstenedione were markedly increased in the ovarian vein serum  indicating ovaries as the source of these steroids. The serum concentration of hCG was 69 mIU mL. Pulsatile secretion of LH persisted in spite of elevated hCG levels. Follicle-stimulating hormone levels were low or undetectable. Elevated hCG levels and low FSH levels resulted in a hormonal environment similar to that seen in polycystic ovary disease  high LH to FSH ratio   resulting in extensive stromal luteinization. Decline in hCG levels after removal of the tumor resulted in the return of androgen levels to normal.

Contrast material studies of the cloaca and the distal limb of the colostomy with fluoroscopy in various projections were essential for diagnosis. Voiding cystourethrography was important for detecting vesicoureteric reflux. Sonography was of limited value for evaluation of the malformation but was valuable for imaging the kidneys. MR imaging revealed that spinal cord abnormalities cannot be predicted based on the appearance of the lumbosacral spine and are more common than previously thought. Jaramillo D  Lebowitz RL  Hendren WH.Total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation in hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland. Hyperparathyroidism caused by multiple-gland hyperplasia has traditionally been treated by subtotal parathyroidectomy. Excellent results have been reported by some  particularly in primary hyperparathyroidism  but other have reported a significant incidence of recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Since 1979  we have chosen to avoid the possibility of remedial exploration of the neck and its attendant risks by treating all patients with primary and secondary hyperplasia with total parathyroidectomy and heterotopic autotransplantation. A total of 20 patients were studied. There were no failures of grafts and no operative complications. We conclude that this procedure is a reliable and safe alternative in the treatment of primary or secondary hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland.

Islet cell dysmaturation syndrome  ICDS  encompasses the causes of infantile hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia histologically described as islet cell hyperplasia  pancreatic adenomatosis and nesidioblastosis. Eleven infants underwent 14 pancreatic resections for ICDS from 1965 to 1990 at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center for severe hypoglycemia unresponsive to medical therapy. Seizures were the presenting symptoms of hypoglycemia in eight infants. Six patients had nesidioblastosis  four had islet cell hyperplasia and one patient had an adenoma with histologically normal pancreatic islet cells. Four neonates underwent 80 per cent pancreatic resection  three with nesidioblastosis required reoperation  90 to 95 per cent resection . Four older infants underwent 80 per cent pancreatic resection but required diazoxide for less than six months postoperatively. Three infants underwent 90 to 95 per cent pancreatic resection. None have required reoperation or postoperative medications. All infants are normoglycemic without pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and none had postoperative complications. Five infants had preoperative neurologic impairment  with three having severe retardation  all showed some improvement postoperatively  but only one infant now has normal findings on neurologic examination. Early diagnosis and aggressive surgical resection should minimize neurologic complications of the ICDS.

One hundred thirty-three patients were entered into a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy for symptomatic gallstones versus extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy plus adjuvant litholytic therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid  UDCA . Six months after lithotripsy  patients receiving placebo were crossed over to UDCA therapy without unblinding the study. One hundred sixteen patients have completed 6 months of follow-up. Five patients were dropped from the study. Nine percent have required cholecystectomy  11 patients with biliary colic and 1 with acute cholecystitis . Ninety-one patients had a solitary stone  64 patients had stones less than or equal to 20 mm and 27 patients had stones greater than 20 mm in diameter   and 25 patients had two to three stones. Fifty percent were retreated. Cumulative stone-free rates at 6  12  and 18 months were 26   39   and 41   respectively. At 6 months there was a significant advantage for patients treated with UDCA versus placebo  36  vs 17  were stone free  that had disappeared by 12 months  placebo-treated patients had received 6 months of UDCA . Patients with solitary stones equal to or less than 20 mm in diameter treated with UDCA had stone-free rates at 6  12  and 18 months of 58   58   and 62   respectively  versus 27   56   and 50 . The difference was significant only at the 6- month follow-up. Stone-free rates for patients with large solitary stones and multiple stones were very low. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is both safe and effective therapy for treatment of symptomatic gallstones in patients with a solitary stone equal to or less than 20 mm in diameter. UDCA markedly improves the efficiency of the procedure and results in a stone-free gallbladder sooner.

Jones CR  Bradley NJ  Davies AJ  Williams GB.Clinical experience with technetium-99m teboroxime  a neutral  lipophilic myocardial perfusion imaging agent. Technetium-99m  Tc-99m  teboroxime is a new technetium-based myocardial perfusion imaging agent  investigational code   SQ30217  Cardiotec  Squibb Diagnostics  . A member of a class of neutral  lipophilic  technetium-containing complexes known as boronic acid adducts of technetium dioxime  BATO  complexes  this agent is chemically very different from the cationic tracer thallium-201  Tl-201  and from the cationic technetium complex Tc-99m sestamibi  Cardiolite  Du Pont Imaging Agents . Tc-99m teboroxime has high myocardial extraction  rapid blood clearance  little lung uptake and rapid myocardial washout. A biexponential pattern of myocardial washout is demonstrated in animals and in man. Effective half-lives of the 2 washout components in man are 5.2 minutes and 3.8 hours and represent approximately 66 and 33  of the myocardial activity  respectively. The first half-life for the myocardium is approximately 11 minutes. As the agent washes out of the heart  hepatic uptake occurs  peaking at about 5 minutes after injection. The liver is the major organ of excretion and receives  along with the large bowel  the largest radiation dose. Rapid imaging protocols using standard cameras have achieved good myocardial counts from 3 planar views acquired over a 4- to 5-minute period or for single photon emission computed tomography  SPECT  images acquired over a 10-minute period. An entire stress rest procedure can be completed in 1 hour. Analysis of data from 155 patients from 4 centers using planar or SPECT imaging showed a sensitivity and specificity for blinded readings of 82 and 91   respectively  when compared against overall clinical impression.

PURPOSE  To investigate the incidence of remote subclinical blastomycosis in a high-risk population of forestry workers. PATIENTS AND METHODS  The study consisted of 39 male forestry workers from northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin  areas endemic for blastomycosis but not for histoplasmosis. All subjects were histoplasmin skin test-negative  and none had ever been diagnosed with blastomycosis or pneumonia. An antigen-specific lymphocyte stimulation assay was performed to determine the presence of blastomycosis. RESULTS  Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 12 of 39 subjects demonstrated specific antigen-induced proliferation when stimulated with a purified alkali- and water-soluble antigen derived from the cell wall of Blastomyces dermatitidis. CONCLUSION  The finding that 30  of these men had evidence of previous blastomycosis suggests that subclinical cases do occur sporadically  and are probably more common than diagnosed symptomatic cases. This is similar to histoplasmosis  in which the majority of infections are subclinical. However  the reservoir of persons with previous undiagnosed blastomycosis is probably small compared to the huge number of persons  perhaps 30 million  with prior histoplasmosis. Vaaler AK  Bradsher RW  Davies SF.Initial failure of surgical exploration in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. To determine the causes of failures of cervical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism  we reviewed 892 patients operated on by one surgeon from 1953 to 1990. Twenty-seven patients  3   remained hypercalcemic or developed hypercalcemia within 6 months of surgery. Of these  five patients had one adenoma removed initially  at reoperation  three patients had a second adenoma that was successfully removed  whereas the other two patients had hyperplasia and required subtotal parathyroidectomies. No enlarged parathyroid glands were identified in 22 patients. Eventually  six patients became normocalcemic spontaneously  seven patients underwent re-exploration with a successful outcome in all but one case  two patients had ectopic hyperparathyroidism associated with carcinoma elsewhere  and seven patients refused reoperation and remain hypercalcemic. The failure rate of surgical exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism can be reduced by systematically exploring all four parathyroid glands. All abnormal parathyroids should be removed with histologic verification. When no abnormal glands are found  localization studies should be performed before re-exploration. Auguste LJ  Attie JN  Schnaap D.Photodynamic therapy with chloroaluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine in the rat window chamber. The efficacy of photodynamic therapy tumor destruction is dependent upon both the interruption of the tumor vasculature and the resultant production of unstable oxygen species causing cellular oxidation and death. Chloroaluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine  CASP  is a recently developed photosensitizer. In order to study the direct vascular effects of CASP on a non-tumor system  a rat window chamber was utilized. Twelve rats were implanted with the window chamber  and were divided into two groups of six. Three rats served as controls for each group  receiving light alone  CASP alone  or no treatment . The remaining 6 rats received 10 mg kg CASP intravenously 4 days after chamber placement. Photoactivation with light was performed 24 hours after injection  power density 200 mW cm2  irradiance 100 J cm2  lambda   675 nm . Utilizing integrating sphere measurements and image analysis  marked vascular changes in the form of initial vasospasm followed by vaso-constriction and loss of chamber neovascularization were noted in the CASP-PDT group. The control groups exhibited no significant changes. Manipulation of the chamber vasculature at strategic time-points may translate into improved response rates for photodynamic therapy in a tumor model. Stern SJ  Flock ST  Small S  Thomsen S  Jacques S.Toxic shock syndrome after inguinal hernia repair. Report of a case with patient survival. A 40-year-old man developed fulminant multisystem failure several days after elective repair of an inguinal hernia. Toxic shock syndrome  TSS  was diagnosed. There was  however  no evidence of wound infection at the time of multisystem failure. Only later in his hospital course did the wound drain. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the wound and was the presumed etiologic agent in the patient s life-threatening illness. The patient recovered fully with supportive care  antibiotics  and surgical debridement of the inguinal hernia site. This case is discussed in the context of existing literature on the toxic shock syndrome. The site of infection is typically nonsuppurative  but the systemic manifestations are typically life threatening. The responsible organism is commonly believed to be a strain of S. aureus that expresses a toxin  TSS toxin-1  that effects multisystem failure  but which also diminishes the local inflammatory response and explains the benign appearance of the wound. Although this is a rare clinical entity  elective surgical procedures complicated by fatal TSS have been reported. Surgeons should understand this disease and the management necessary to avert mortality. Slingluff CL Jr  Burns WW  Cooperberg C.Immunohistochemical interpretation of early epithelial disorders of pyriform sinus. Expression of cytokeratins  CKs  was investigated immunohistochemically by use of monospecific monoclonal anti-CK antibodies in normal epithelia of pyriform sinus and epithelial lesions such as simple hyperplasia  different degrees of dysplasia  in situ carcinoma  and invasive carcinoma. In normal epithelium  strong expression of CK-19 was consistently observed only in the basal layer as basic CK  while expression of CK-13 showed a completely reverse pattern  being expressed only in suprabasal layers as stratification-related CK. Characteristic changes in expression pattern of these two CKs were observed in accordance with the degree of epithelial disorders and differentiation of carcinoma. Cytokeratin 1  as keratinization-associated CK  was observed only in keratinized cells of hyperplastic epithelia and well-differentiated carcinomas. These findings may be useful in evaluating epithelial disorders and classifying carcinomas more objectively  and may assist earlier detection of carcinoma when used with standard histologic techniques. Murakami Y  Saito Y.The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in nonulcer dyspepsia. Importance of stratification according to age  see comments  Helicobacter pylori  formerly Campylobacter pylori  is causally related to active antral gastritis and is highly associated with duodenal and gastric ulcers. However  the relationship of H pylori to nonulcer dyspepsia is less clear. We determined the presence of H pylori in unselected patients who were undergoing upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy  and we found a prevalence of 37  in 110 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia that was similar to previous data. Patients with nonulcer dyspepsia who had H pylori were found to be significantly older than patients with nonulcer dyspepsia who did not have H pylori. In addition  when stratified according to age  we detected an increased prevalence of H pylori in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia with increasing age  similar to that reported for asymptomatic control populations. This finding casts doubt as to the causal role of H pylori for most patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and stresses the importance of considering epidemiologic factors  such as age  when evaluating the role of H pylori in specific disease states.

There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature.

Continuous infusion of endothelin at a rate of 60 micrograms kg day into the jugular vein of rats via osmotic minipumps induced a significant increase in systolic blood pressure  but did not induce any significant changes in urine volume and urinary sodium excretion  compared to those in vehicle-infused rats. When 6 mg kg day of benidipine  a newly developed calcium channel blocker  was administered simultaneously with 60 micrograms kg day of endothelin  the systolic blood pressure of conscious rats rose on Day 1 to only 137.0   - 2.4 mm Hg  P less than .05  compared to the rise to 163.8   - 4.7 mm Hg when endothelin alone was infused. The antihypertensive effect of benidipine was sustained. The present results suggest that endothelin can act as a circulating hormone. In addition  they clearly demonstrate that the calcium channel blocker attenuates the elevation of blood pressure induced by endothelin.

The superior patency and clinical advantages of internal mammary artery  IMA  grafting are well established. However  the relative benefits of routine multiple IMA grafting remain uncertain. To determine whether routine multiple compared with single IMA utilization improved survival of patients undergoing coronary bypass procedures  1 063 patients were prospectively allocated  beginning in 1984  to divergent management strategies of single  group 1  n   420  versus multiple IMA grafting  group 2  n   643 .

A case of massive true thymic hyperplasia with non-Hodgkin s lymphoma of the mediastinum is reported in a 14-year-old boy. Computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a mass of the anterior mediastinum and conspicuous swelling of the lymph nodes in the upper and lower mediastinum. They were grossly resected. The tumor of the anterior mediastinum was histologically diagnosed as true thymic hyperplasia. All of the mediastinal lymph nodes were diagnosed as non-Hodgkin s lymphoma  diffuse  mixed small and large cell type.

Electrical stimulation of cranial and peripheral nerves has been used to ameliorate a variety of neurologic disease states and neural injuries over the past 20 years. In this review  clinical applications and the histopathologic results of chronic implants in animals and humans are discussed  and the results of neural damage models developed at Huntington Medical Research Institutes are summarized. Chronically implanted electrode arrays may produce neural injury by either mechanical factors or by continuous  high-frequency electrical stimulation. The margin of safety to avoid electrically induced injury may be increased by minimizing the frequency or total stimulation time  and by the use of an intermittent duty cycle. The protocols presently being used for the stimulation of the vagus nerve to effect inhibition of seizures appear to have an adequate margin of safety. Agnew WF  McCreery DB.Late onset adrenal hyperplasia  mutation at codon 282 of the functional 21-hydroxylase gene is not ubiquitous. Ten patients affected with 21-hydroxylase  21-OH  deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia were studied to determine the prevalence of a mutation at codon 281 of the functional 21-OH gene  CYP21B  that results in a valine to leucine amino acid shift. This mutation has been reported in eight unrelated late-onset adrenal hyperplasia patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent possessing the human leukocyte antigen-B14 DR1 haplotype. Normally  there are two 21-OH genes  a pseudogene  CYP21A  and a functional gene  CYP21B . The aberrant codon 281 sequence is normally present only in CYP21A. In all of our late-onset adrenal hyperplasia patients  hybridization of an oligonucleotide probe specific for this mutation was demonstrated to CYP21A but not to CYP21B. The mutation at codon 281 of CYP21B does not appear to be a ubiquitous genetic marker for 21-OH deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia  suggesting that this disorder may demonstrate the same molecular heterogeneity as congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

Proceedings.Adenomyosis in Pakistani women  four year experience at the Aga Khan University Medical Centre  Karachi. As part of a quality assurance programme at the Aga Khan University Medical Centre  Karachi  Pakistan  all hysterectomy specimens were reviewed from January 1986 to December 1989. Adenomyosis was found in 237 of the 419  56.5   specimens studied. Of these 237 patients  232  97.9   were parous and 196  82.8   were in the fourth and fifth decades of life. This high prevalence in parous women aged 40-59 years was significant. Fibroids  cervicitis  and endometrial hyperplasia were the most common associated diagnoses. Of all the associations studied  only endometrial hyperplasia was significantly more prevalent in the group with adenomyosis. Adenomyosis was stated as an indication for surgery in 69 patients and was confirmed by histopathology in 49  71  . Preoperative suspicion of adenomyosis was present in 49  20.6   patients of all those ultimately found to have the disease. There is a high prevalence of adenomyosis in the population studied  which indicates that the condition may have been underdiagnosed in the past  especially as it is difficult to diagnose without surgery and hysterectomy is currently the only treatment.

Go CS  Farish SE  DeBoom GW.Control of IL-2 receptor-alpha expression by IL-1  tumor necrosis factor  and IL-2. Complex regulation via elements in the 5  flanking region. We have analyzed the mechanisms by which IL-1  IL-2  and TNF regulate expression of IL-2R alpha chain in a rodent T cell line. All three cytokines induce detectable IL-2R alpha mRNA by themselves  but there is strong synergy between IL-1 or TNF  on the one hand  and IL-2  on the other. The earliest phase of induction by IL-1 is independent of protein synthesis. IL-1  but not TNF  also stimulates transient secretion of IL-2. This leads to an autocrine stimulation of a further increase in IL-2R alpha mRNA levels. When IL-2 secretion has dropped off  continued IL-2R alpha expression requires both IL-2 and IL-1. Most or all of this regulation is due to changes in the rate of transcription of the IL-2R alpha gene. The response to IL-1 and IL-2 depends on a segment in the IL-2R alpha 5  flanking region  upstream of all cis-acting regulatory elements previously identified in the human gene.

DeGaetano D  Siegel JA.Effects of energy restriction on mouse mammary tumor virus mRNA levels in mammary glands and uterus and on uterine endometrial hyperplasia and pituitary histology in C3H SHN F1 mice. We investigated the effects of energy restriction on the pituitary-ovarian axis and on a hormone responsive gene  the mouse mammary tumor virus  MMTV . Female C3H SHN F1-hybrid mice  known to display a high incidence of mammary tumors  ate an energy-restricted diet  48 kcal wk  or a control diet  95 kcal wk  beginning at the time of weaning. By 67 wk of age  12 of 32 mice in the control group  but none of the 33 mice in the energy-restricted group  had developed mammary tumors. Six tumor-free mice from each group were studied in detail at 67 wk of age. All six tumor-free control mice  but none of the six energy-restricted mice  showed uterine endometrial hyperplasia at autopsy. Mice subjected to energy restriction did not display an estrous cycle. The average levels of MMTV mRNA in mammary glands and uteri were strongly reduced by energy restriction. MMTV mRNA levels in mammary glands from control mice were two orders of magnitude lower than those in mammary tumors. Energy restriction lowered the percentage of pituitary mammatropes and suppressed proliferation of mammatropes with advancing age. Energy restriction thus appeared to inhibit endometrial hyperplasia and to decrease MMTV production at the mRNA level in the mammary glands and in the uterus. These effects may be a consequence of hormonal changes originating at the pituitary-ovarian axis. Koizumi A  Wada Y  Tsukada M  Kamiyama S  Weindruch R.Prevention in developing countries. Developing countries have implemented primary health care programs directed primarily at prevention and management of important infectious and nutritional problems of children. Successful programs have emphasized the need for individual and community involvement and have been characterized by responsible government policies for equitable implementation of efficacious and cost-effective health interventions. Unfortunately  developing countries must also face increases in the chronic disease and social problems commonly associated with industrialized countries. Prevention efforts  for example  to reduce tobacco smoking  to modify the diet  to reduce injuries  or to avert environmental contamination  are needed to contain future morbidity and rapidly increasing medical care costs. Developing countries can build on their successful approaches to program implementation and add other measures directed at preservation of health and prevention of disease in adult as well as child populations. Black RE.Mucous cell hyperplasia in an odontogenic cyst from a patient with Muir-Torre syndrome. Mucous cell proliferation in a periapical radicular cyst from a patient with a family history of colonic malignancies and multiple sebaceous neoplasms of the skin  so-called Muir-Torre syndrome  is reported. Such goblet cell hyperplasia has not been previously reported to be associated with any known syndrome. We believe the finding of mucous cell hyperplasia in an odontogenic cyst may not simply be coincidental  but should raise suspicion of paraneoplastic potential and warrant further evaluation for possible occult neoplastic disease. Swerdloff M  Archard HO  Krimsky PK.Mohan s urethral valvotome  a new instrument. Electrothermic fulguration of posterior urethral valves with a resectoscope is difficult in newborns  especially in small for gestation date and premature newborns because of a small caliber urethra. This difficulty has prompted the innovation of the valvotome described. The outer diameter of the valvotome is 3 mm. and it can be easily introduced without stretching the urethra. This instrument has been used successfully in 8 patients to date. Patient age ranged from 3 days to 3 1 2 years with varying degrees of hydronephrosis and hydroureter. All patients have a good urinary stream with regression of the hydronephrosis and hydroureter. Abraham MK.From the National Institutes of Health. Raub W.From the Food and Drug administration. Nightingale SL.Malignant transformation of adenomatous hyperplasia to hepatocellular carcinoma. To clarify the course of adenomatous hyperplasia  AH  of the liver  17 patients with 20 biopsy-proven AH nodules were followed clinically for 1-5 years. At the initial biopsy the mean nodular diameter was 10  SD 4  mm and the relative cellularity    mean cellularity of AH divided by mean parenchymal cellularity  x 100  141  27 . The criteria for diagnosis of malignant transformation of AH were both a doubling of nodular volume and changes on imaging. Between 6 and 50 months after biopsy  9 of the 18 nodules which could still be accurately identified met the criteria for transformation  histological proof of hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC  was obtained later for 7 of these 9 nodules. The product of diameter and cellularity  transformation index  was the strongest predictor of the time to transformation. 9 AH nodules did not undergo transformation--7 did not meet one or both criteria and 2 became undetectable by imaging. Because of the high risk of malignant transformation  it can be concluded that AH is an absolute precursor of HCC. It should therefore be treated as a potential malignant disorder.

In this study  the computed tomography scans of 100 patients with chronic hyperplastic rhinosinusitis were reviewed to establish a clinical staging system. Fourteen percent of the patients were classified as Stage I  single-focus disease   36  as Stage II  multifocal disease responsive to conservative therapy   32  as Stage III  diffuse disease partially responsive to medication   and 16  as Stage IV  diffuse disease associated with bony changes and poorly responsive to conservative treatment . The incidence of recurrent or persistent disease ranged from 13  for Stage II to 30  for Stage IV. Stage I and III patients had 13  and 18  recurrence rates  respectively. Computed tomography staging is shown to be useful in outlining operative strategies and is a reliable prognosticator of the disease process.

One hundred eighty-eight women who had endometrial cells on cervical cytologic specimens during the secretory phase or in the postmenopausal period were studied retrospectively. Each had undergone hysterectomy or endometrial biopsy within 12 months of the original smear. The endometrial cells were classified as typical  atypical  or suspicious for carcinoma. Among premenopausal subjects  three of 57 with typical cells had endometrial hyperplasia  one of two with atypical cells had endometrial polyps  and both with cells suspicious for carcinoma had endometrial carcinoma. In the postmenopausal group  ten  13.5   of 74 with typical endometrial cells had either hyperplasia or carcinoma  and five  22.7   of 22 with atypical cells and 24 77.4   of 31 patients with suspicious cells had either hyperplasia or carcinoma. The present findings and a review of the pertinent literature demonstrate that the classification system used is helpful in predicting the risk for endometrial disease in patients with endometrial cells seen on cervical cytologic smears during the secretory phase or in the postmenopausal period.

The clinical and histologic presentation of this side effect and possible biochemical mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed. Brown RS  Sein P  Corio R  Bottomley WK.Interactions between substance P  calcitonin gene-related peptide  taurine and excitatory amino acids in the spinal cord. Using in vivo microdialysis in the dorsal spinal cord of the rat  we have previously observed increases in glutamate and aspartate during exposure to a noxious stimulus. The present investigation was designed to determine whether these increases may be mediated by substance P. Infusion of 1 mM of substance P in the dialysis fluid increased the concentrations of glutamate and aspartate  similar to the response seen during noxious stimulation. In addition  substance P also increased the concentrations of the inhibitory amino acids glycine and taurine. Calcitonin gene-related peptide  previously shown to enhance substance P-induced biting and scratching behavior  produced no effect on amino acid release by itself but potentiated the apparent release of taurine by substance P. To assess the importance of substance P-induced amino acid release in sensory processing  we examined the influence of taurine and of excitatory amino acid antagonists on the biting and scratching behavior produced by excitatory amino acids and substance P. Taurine selectively inhibited only substance P-induced biting and scratching while excitatory amino acid antagonists inhibited only excitatory amino acid-induced behavior. To further explore the ability of taurine to inhibit the substance P-induced behavior  3 tests of nociception were then used. Pretreatment with taurine inhibited the nociceptive-related writhing behavior produced by an intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid in mice but failed to alter the latency of response in the hot plate or tail flick assay. ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS  Smullin DH  Skilling SR  Larson AA.Expression of the murine fibroblast growth factor 5 gene in the adult central nervous system. The murine homolog of the fibroblast growth factor-5  FGF-5  gene has been cloned  and the sequence of the gene s three exons has been determined. The murine gene and the previously isolated human FGF-5 gene are substantially homologous within the coding sequences and in upstream sequences  which contain an additional open reading frame. We have used a portion of the murine gene as probe to detect FGF-5 RNA in adult mouse tissues by both Northern blot and in situ hybridization methods. FGF-5 RNA is present at low levels in widely distributed areas of the central nervous system. Several loci of FGF-5 expression could be localized by in situ hybridization and include portions of the cerebral cortex  hippocampus  and thalamus. Neuronal expression accounts for at least some of the FGF-5 RNA synthesized in the central nervous system. Haub O  Drucker B  Goldfarb M.Enterobacter bacteremia in pediatric patients. Enterobacter has emerged as an important human pathogen  particularly in sick  hospitalized patients. Previous reports of nonepidemic enterobacter bacteremia have focused on adult patients. In this report  the epidemiologic factors  clinical characteristics  treatment  and outcome for 33 patients with enterobacter bacteremia in a large children s hospital during a 5-year period are reviewed. The ratio of males to females was 1.2 1. The patients  ages ranged from 2 days to 24 years  and 18 patients were less than 18 months old. Twenty-two cases were nosocomially acquired  six were polymicrobial in nature. Significantly underlying conditions were present in 32 patients. The biliary tract and central venous catheters were the most common sources of bacteremia. Two-thirds of patients had preceding antibiotic therapy. The overall mortality was 24   mortality attributable to enterobacter bacteremia was 18 . Statistically significant differences in mortality were associated with an age less than 18 months  P   .031  or thrombocytopenia  P   .017   presence of fever was of borderline significance  P   .098 . Enterobacter bacteremia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Gallagher PG.Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. Twenty-four patients underwent biopsy or resection of the liver for focal nodular hyperplasia  FNH  at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1978 to 1988. Twenty-two of the patients were women. The mean age was 35 years. A history of antecedent oral contraceptive or conjugated estrogen  Premarin  use was obtained in 18 of 21 women. There were two men  aged 26 and 37 years  neither gave a history of hormone use. Most of the tumors were solitary  22 of 24  and located in the left lobe of the liver  17 of 22 . Fifteen of the patients had a prior or simultaneous malignant lesion and six had other benign tumors. Most of the tumors were resected with a wedge or subsegment of liver  13 of 24 . Four patients underwent segmentectomy and five required lobectomy for removal of the tumors. Two patients had an intraoperative biopsy only. The patients in whom the tumor was diagnosed preoperatively underwent computed tomography and arteriography routinely. Scintigraphy of the liver with sulfur colloid was obtained in only three patients  despite its distinct potential for nonoperative diagnosis of FNH. Brady MS  Coit DG.An overview of intimal hyperplasia. Many hypotheses have been postulated for the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein and prosthetic grafts. In these hypotheses  the central theme seems to be endothelial injury  but not always denuding injury. As we progress into the biologic era with more sophisticated research tools  the study of the endothelial cell may give us the answers to the problem of intimal hyperplasia. In addition  the leukocyte is still a relatively unknown entity and further modification of their function may hold promise.

We measured regional cerebral blood flow using the xenon-133 inhalation method  at approximately 1 month after onset  in 60 stroke patients who had no evidence of major carotid artery stenosis or occlusion. Their single lesions  43 infarcts and 17 hematomas  were located in the capsulothalamolenticular region  sparing the cortex. Hemispheric mean cerebral blood flow was reduced on the side of the lesion in 25 patients and on both sides in 20. Regional hypoperfusion was observed in 46 patients  ipsilaterally in 34  bilaterally in 10  and contralaterally in two . Regional hypoperfusion was observed most frequently in the frontal lobe  particularly in the motor and premotor cortices of the prerolandic area. The 46 patients with regional hypoperfusion were compared with the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion  considering the size and location of the lesion as well as the functional and analytic motor performances. As a rule  the lesion was slightly smaller and more posterior and the functional  p less than 0.001  and analytic  p less than 0.05  motor performances were significantly better in the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion. Since the xenon-133 inhalation method examines cortical blood flow  we can attribute blood flow reductions resulting from deep-seated lesions to a functional depression akin to diaschisis. Interpretation of the clinical consequences and pathogenesis of this phenomenon requires further sequential and pathologic studies.

Brown PS Jr  Roberts CS  McIntosh CL  Roberts WC  Clark RE.Potential value of hormone receptor assay in carcinoma in situ of breast. The estrogen receptor  ER  expression of invasive breast cancer has been extensively studied both biochemically and with specific monoclonal antibodies against ER. Relatively few studies have attempted to characterize ER pattern in breast carcinoma in situ  CIS  and in other premalignant lesions. In the current study  the authors investigated the pattern of ER expression in 62 cases of breast CIS  30 of which had a component of invasive cancer  and 36 cases of atypical hyperplasia. Paraffin sections of formalin-fixed breast tissue underwent enzyme pretreatment to expose nuclear antigenic sites as previously described. Breast tissues then underwent estrogen immunocytochemical assay using specific monoclonal antibodies  Abbott Laboratory  Chicago  IL . The cases were evaluated for heterogeneity  intensity of staining  and percentage of ER-positive cells. An attempt was made to study the relation between the pattern of ER expression  nuclear pleomorphism  and type of CIS. The results of ER immunocytochemical assay showed positive nuclear staining for ER in 75  of the CIS  73  of CIS with invasive cancer  and 100  of atypical hyperplasias. ER expression in CIS agreed with that in the invasive carcinoma in 29 of 30 cases. This study also suggests that comedocarcinoma has a higher incidence of negative ER expression than the other types of CIS  particularly when it is associated with significant nuclear pleomorphism. There was no significant difference in ER tumor heterogeneity between premalignant and malignant lesions.

A mixture of 3 synthetic peptides  35.1  55.1  and 83.1  corresponding to portions of the 35 kDa  55 kDa  and 83 kDa proteins from the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum and a polymer of a syntheic peptide incorporating the 3 individual peptides  SPf66  were tested as candidate malaria vaccine antigens in Aotus nancymai. Monkeys were immunized with combinations of the 3 peptides from 2 separate sources  Centers for Disease Control  CDC   Atlanta  GA or Colombia  or with the synthetic polymer. Animals immunized with a combination of the 3 peptides from CDC had higher antibody titers to the 35.1 and 55.1 peptides than to the 83.1 peptide. Monkeys immunized with a combination of the 3 peptides produced in Colombia developed higher levels of antibody to the 55.1 than to the 83.1 and 35.1 peptides. Animals immunized with the polymer produced detectable antibodies to the 55.1 peptide alone. Following challenge with P. falciparum  no differences were observed between the 3 vaccine groups and 2 control groups with respect to the number of animals with parasitemias greater than or equal to 10 . The inconsistency of serologic response to all 3 peptides in these animals contrasted with previous trials performed in Colombia where the monkeys developed high antibody titers against the 3 peptides and were protected against the experimental infection. Ruebush TK2d  Campbell GH  Moreno A  Patarroyo ME  Collins WE.Critical need for a National Institute of Emergency Medicine  editorial  Mickel HS.Risk for colon adenomas in patients with rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyps  see comments  OBJECTIVE  To determine whether hyperplastic polyps found in the rectosigmoid area of the colon are associated with proximal adenomas  and to judge whether patients with distal hyperplastic polyps found during sigmoidoscopy might benefit from full colonoscopy. DESIGN  Data on patients having colonoscopy collected prospectively according to a set protocol. The size and location of all polyps were noted  and all polyps were biopsied. SETTING  Two university hospitals. PATIENTS  One thousand eight hundred and thirty-six consecutive patients referred for colonoscopy between 31 December 1987 and 31 August 1989. RESULTS  Of the 970 patients who met eligibility requirements  274  28.3   had adenomas and 108  11.1   had hyperplastic polyps. The proportion of patients with distal hyperplastic polyps and proximal adenomas  31.9   was similar to the proportion of those without distal hyperplastic polyps  23.0    crude odds ratio  1.57  95  CI  0.77 to 3.06 . After adjusting for age and sex  the results were unchanged  adjusted odds ratio  1.53  CI  0.82 to 2.88 . Patients with distal adenomas  on the other hand  were three times more likely to have proximal adenomas than those without distal adenomas  adjusted odds ratio  3.42  CI  1.99 to 5.88 . CONCLUSIONS  Distal hyperplastic polyps are not strong predictors of risk for proximal adenomas. Based on the magnitude of the risk difference  we do not believe that finding a hyperplastic polyp during sigmoidoscopy justifies doing a full colonoscopy to search for proximal adenomas. Because rectosigmoid adenomas are associated with proximal adenomas  however  small polyps seen during sigmoidoscopy should be biopsied to determine their type. Colonoscopy should be reserved for patients who are proved to have adenomas. Provenzale D  Garrett JW  Condon SE  Sandler RS.Myasthenic thymus and thymoma are selectively enriched in acetylcholine receptor-reactive T cells. We compared T-cell proliferative responses to acetylcholine receptor  AChR  and to purified protein derivative  PPD   of tuberculin  of hyperplastic thymus  thymoma  and blood cells from patients with myasthenia gravis  MG . Hyperplastic MG thymus cells gave significantly higher and more consistent responses to AChR than parallel cultures of autologous blood cells  whereas responses to PPD showed an opposite trend. Thus there was a preferential localization of AChR-reactive T cells in the hyperplastic MG thymus. Furthermore  there was a strong correlation between blood and thymus cell responses to PPD  but not to AChR   arguing that the hyperplastic MG thymus contains a sample of sensitized peripheral T cells. By contrast  both AChR- and PPD-responsive T cells were almost undetectable in thymus from nonmyasthenic patients  which is evidently much less receptive to circulating T cells. Cells from MG thymomas showed the highest stimulations by AChR but did not consistently react to PPD. However  the uninvolved thymus adjacent to these thymomas behaved almost identically to the hyperplastic samples described above. Our interpretation is that AChR-specific T cells are initially sensitized in the MG thymoma but are selectively trapped in the hyperplastic thymus after being primed elsewhere.

Hall JG.Antibiotic pharmacokinetics in surgery  see comments  Pharmacokinetics is the study of variables that affect drug concentrations at the effector site. The descriptive terms peak concentration  elimination half-life  volume of distribution  and bioavailability are commonly used to express pharmacokinetic variability among drugs used in patient care. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of drugs are important for surgeons to understand because they represent differences that may assume clinical significance when selecting antibiotics for preoperative preventive indications. In addition  the changing hemodynamic pattern of the stressed and septic patient may result in changing pharmacokinetic patterns for an antibiotic  which  in turn  may require changes in the dosing regimen during the course of treatment.

Three methods of arrhythmia analysis  magnitude-squared coherence  ventricular rate  and irregularity of cycle length were performed for 45 episodes of induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia in 15 patients. Differentiation of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was possible by mean magnitude-squared coherence  less possible by rate  and not possible by beat-to-beat irregularity. Faster monomorphic ventricular tachycardia overlapped with rates of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Differentiation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was not possible by rate or irregularity. A progressive decrease in mean magnitude-squared coherence from monomorphic ventricular tachycardia to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia to ventricular fibrillation strengthens previous observations that coherence is a measure of rhythm  organization.  Ropella KM  Baerman JM  Sahakian AV  Swiryn S.The HIV cytopathic effect  potential target for therapy  HIV kills activated infected CD4  T cells after a burst of replication and the release of large numbers of virions. From a review of the literature on HIV regulatory genes and from preliminary mathematical models of HIV dynamics at four levels  host population epidemiology  the immune system  gene regulation within infected cells  and selection of mutants  we have arrived at the theory that in the etiology of HIV the HIV cytopathic effect may actively be caused by a viral regulatory gene product. The most likely candidate is the rev regulatory protein. Rev and the analogous rex protein from HTLV-I  human T cell leukemia virus  both have two active sites with similar function  one site locates the protein in the nucleus nucleolus  and the other site interacts with viral mRNAs  facilitating their export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Rev seems to have a third functional site near the 3  end. We conjecture that this site may be responsible for the cytopathic effect. We think that rev acts on cellular genes that normally induce senescence and cell death during development  or T-cell maturation  or on terminal differentiation. We propose that mathematical and computer models of the immune system could be used to explore whether suppression of the cytopathic action of the rev protein could be of therapeutic benefit in restoring the ability of the immune system to clear HIV or at least to extend latency. We also suggest how immune deficiency disease might be created as laboratory artifact in animal populations. Bremermann HJ  Anderson RW.A study of the relationship between blood flow and bacterial inoculation in musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps. Regional nutrient blood flow to musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flaps was studied in dogs using 15-microns radiolabeled microspheres  and correlations to bacterial inoculation into closed wound spaces were sought. During the 6-day study period  no differences were found between blood flow to noinoculated versus inoculated flaps. Comparisons of blood flow to the deep surfaces of the flaps showed that blood flow to muscle in musculocutaneous flaps increased rapidly during the first 24 hours and then plateaued  while that to subcutaneous tissue plus fascia in fasciocutaneous flaps demonstrated a gradual and steady increase. The most rapid decline in bacterial counts at the undersurface of both flaps occurred within 24 hours  dropping significantly lower within musculocutaneous flaps. In addition to such surface properties of muscle as tissue ingrowth  rapid early augmentation of muscle blood flow may be largely responsible for superior bacterial suppression observed beneath musculocutaneous flaps.

The authors report on the cytologic features of six cases of poorly differentiated  insular  carcinoma  IC  of the thyroid  a recently described variety of thyroid tumor intermediate between well-differentiated and anaplastic neoplasms. It is characterized by trabecular and or alveolar growth patterns  merging with follicular areas  and by the absence of pleomorphism in the tumor cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy  FNAB  materials  both smears and cell-block preparations  from six patients were reviewed after the diagnosis of IC was confirmed on the surgical specimen. The following cytologic features were consistently found  high cellularity and necrotic background  low grade of atypia  trabeculae and or clusters  possibly associated with microfollicles  of cells with poorly defined cytoplasm  and cytoplasmic vacuoles containing thyroglobulin. Nuclear inclusions and grooving of the nuclear surface were additional features. Preoperative diagnosis suggestive of IC might be of value for planning surgical treatment and subsequent therapy. Pietribiasi F  Sapino A  Papotti M  Bussolati G.Immunohistochemical study of cytokeratin expression in normal and pathologic middle ear mucosa of the rat. The expression of cytokeratins in the epithelium of the middle ear and external auditory meatus of the rat was studied on cryosections of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-decalcified specimens by use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The normal middle ear epithelium revealed a complex cytokeratin profile  including regional differences. The induction of sterile middle ear effusions resulted in increased cytokeratin expression. Infective effusions were accompanied by both quantitative and qualitative changes in the cytokeratin expression patterns. The differences observed between the cytokeratin profiles of external meatal skin and those of middle ear epithelium may form a useful tool for research into cholesteatoma development. Vennix PP  Kuijpers W  Tonnaer EL  Peters TA  Ramaekers FC.The natural history of intimal flaps in a canine model. The natural history of arterial intimal flaps has not been well defined. This study characterizes the natural history of unrepaired intimal flaps. Thirty-nine 1-  2-  and 3-mm hemispheric  distally based intimal flaps were made in 4- to 5-mm diameter canine femoral and carotid arteries. Twenty arteries had 2- and 3-mm intimal flaps and were monitored for short-term arterial thrombosis and flap extension. Nineteen had 1- and 2-mm intimal flaps and were monitored for thrombosis  long-term development of neointimal hyperplasia  arterial stenosis  and persistence of the flap. While 40  of the arteries with 3-mm intimal flaps developed thrombosis in 3 to 5 days  only 3  of the arteries with 1- or 2-mm intimal flaps developed thrombosis. Most 1- to 2-mm intimal flaps resolved and the subsequent development of neointimal hyperplasia or arterial stenosis was minimal. Arteries with hemodynamically significant stenoses from intimal flaps warrant repair  while arteries with smaller intimal flaps may not require repair.

One hundred hips in patients who had had primary uncemented replacements were followed up for one or two years  and assessed by five different methods. All produced different results. The Hospital for Special Surgery rating produced the most optimistic assessment and the Merle d Aubigne rating the most pessimistic. The functional class of the patients  as defined by Charnley in 1979  significantly affected the ratings  and these should clearly be included in all rating systems. Moreover  if systems are to be compared  they should all use descriptive words  such as limp or pain  in precisely the same way.

Arnold AC  Baloh RW  Yee RD  Hepler RS.Function in athymic nude mice of parathyroid heterografts from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Heterotransplantation of adenomatous parathyroid glandular tissue from humans with primary hyperparathyroidism into athymic nude mice creates a unique animal model of this disease. The mice manifest high concentrations of both midregion C-terminal human parathyroid hormone and biologically active intact human parathyroid hormone relative to either mice with no implants or mice that received normal human parathyroid tissue. Secretion of these substances is maintained in most mice for at least 9 to 13 months after implantation. In addition  animals that have experienced implantation exhibit other characteristics associated with human primary hyperparathyroidism including relative hypercalcemia and increased renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha-hydroxylase activity. We also measured these parameters in a group of nude mice that received transplantation of a similar mass of hyperplastic parathyroid tissue that was obtained from patients with uremic secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although we hypothesized that the level of human parathyroid hormone secretion from these implants would fall over time in response to the normal host environment  hormone levels remained as high as those in recipients of adenomatous heterografts  even after 9 to 13 months. Moreover  similar biologic effect of the excess parathyroid hormone  i.e.  relative hypercalcemia  hyperphosphatasemia  and increased 1 25-dihydroxyvitamin D biosynthesis  were detected. These animal models should prove extremely useful in supplementing our understanding of hyperparathyroid disorder in man. Schachter P  Christy MD  Leight GS Jr  Lobaugh B.The role of adrenalectomy in Cushing s syndrome. Forty-four patients with Cushing s syndrome were treated by adrenalectomy between 1975 and 1989. Twenty patients had adrenal adenomas  13 with obvious Cushing s syndrome and 7 whose disease was subclinical  detected after evaluation of an incidentally discovered adrenal mass  es . Twelve patients underwent bilateral adrenalectomies for Cushing s disease after failed transsphenoidal explorations and pituitary irradiation. Six patients had primary adrenal hyperplasia  five as manifestations of Carney s complex. Two others underwent bilateral adrenalectomies for ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone from carcinoid tumors. Four patients had adrenocortical carcinoma treated with transabdominal adrenalectomy. Three are alive from 8 years to 5 months. There was one postoperative death  2.3   caused by coagulopathy and multiple organ failure and three  7   minor postoperative complications. Follow-up showed good to excellent results in 95  of patients. It is concluded that adrenalectomy provides prompt relief from the severe morbidity of Cushing s syndrome regardless of the cause. It is the treatment of choice for adrenal adenomas  carcinomas  primary hyperplasia  and selected patients with Cushing s disease.

Awotedu AA  Otulana BA  Ukoli CO.Effect of delayed captopril therapy on left ventricular mass and myonecrosis during acute coxsackievirus murine myocarditis. The effect of captopril on coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis was investigated. Thirty-two  3-week-old mice were infected with coxsackievirus B3 on day 0 of the study  then randomized into a placebo group or a captopril group starting on day 3 of infection. On day 9 of infection  the mice were put to death. Hearts were weighed and processed for light microscopic examination. Heart weight was 125   - 19 mg in the control group versus 102   - 14 mg in the captopril group  p less than 0.0003 . Amount of necrosis as a percentage of left ventricular section was 3.5   2.0  to 7.5   in the placebo group versus 2.0   0.0  to 5.0   in the captopril group  p less than 0.01 . The amount of dystrophic calcification was 5.0   0.0  to 27.5   in the placebo group versus 1.3   0.0  to 20.0   in the captopril group  p less than 0.01 . The extent of the histopathologic involvement by planimetry was 10.2  in the placebo group versus 5.4  in the captopril group  p   0.052 . We conclude that captopril is beneficial in decreasing left ventricular mass and the amount of myocardial necrosis and calcification in the short term in the murine myocarditis model. Rezkalla S  Kloner RA  Khatib G  Khatib R.Unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the neck. We analyzed retrospectively 157 cases of metastatic neck squamous cell carcinoma from unknown primary sites  treated with surgery  radiotherapy  excisional biopsy  and combined modalities. Median follow-up was 74 months  and overall actuarial survival was 55  at 5 years. The surgery-treated group  despite a higher rate of manifesting primary tumors  had significantly better survival at 5 years compared with those receiving radiation therapy  of whom 23  had residual disease after treatment. Primary tumors were discovered during follow-up in 16  overall. Different treatments yielded comparable results in lower-staged neck disease  NX  N1  N2a   while surgery appeared more effective in controlling advanced disease  N2b  N3a . Factors that affected survival include neck stage  connective tissue invasion  and presence of recurrent or residual disease after treatment. Wang RC  Goepfert H  Barber AE  Wolf P.Prognostic significance of type IV collagen and laminin immunoreactivity in urothelial carcinomas of the bladder. Invasion of a carcinoma involves the degradation and penetration of the subepithelial basement membrane  BM . This phenomenon might be used for histopathologic evaluation of neoplasms of the bladder. The authors studied the clinicopathologic data and tissue specimens of 125 cases of urothelial carcinomas collected prospectively. Penetration of the BM was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of the BM components laminin and type IV collagen. The use of this parameter as a prognostic indicator in bladder cancer was assessed. The 5-year survival rate of patients having tumors with an interrupted or absent BM was significantly lower than that of patients having tumors with an intact BM. The rate of progression was greater in tumors with an interrupted or absent BM than in tumors with an intact BM. No association was found between BM status and recurrence. However  a significant correlation between tumor stage and BM staining was found. A correlation was also found between ploidy and BM staining as well as between histologic grade and BM staining pattern. When evaluating histologic grade  stage  ploidy  age  and BM score as prognostic parameters  the stage of bladder carcinomas turned out to be the most important factor in predicting the survival rate and the progression-free survival. However  BM staining was found to be of value for early identification of microinvasion and is helpful for correct staging of urothelial carcinomas.

Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1  ELAM-1  is an endothelial cell adhesion molecule that allows myeloid cells to attach to the walls of blood vessels adjacent to sites of inflammation. ELAM-1 recognizes the sialyl-Lewis X  sialyl-Lex  determinant  NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4 Fuc alpha 1-3 GlcNAc-  a granulocyte carbohydrate also found on the surface of some tumor cell lines. Binding of myeloid cells to soluble ELAM-1 is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody recognizing sialyl-Lex or by proteins bearing sialyl-Lex  some of which may participate in humoral regulation of myeloid cell adhesion. Stimulated granulocytes also release an inhibitor of ELAM-1 binding that can be selectively adsorbed by monoclonal antibody to sialyl-Lex.

This paper is a presentation of the unusual case of a 61-yr-old woman operated on for multiple gastric cancers. Two of the cancers were found in the hyperplastic polyps and one in the adenoma. Apart from cancers that arose from these polyps  there were four separate polypoid or flat gastric carcinomas and three other hyperplastic polyps with no signs of malignancy  in this case. The presentation is followed by a detailed discussion focusing on the possible development of carcinoma in gastric hyperplastic polyps in view of the data from the literature. Orlowska J  Pietrow D.Lack of correlation of clinical breast examination with high-risk histopathology. PURPOSE  Routine breast examination frequently finds differences in palpable density and palpable nodularity  but it is not known if these differences correlate with the presence of high-risk histopathology. PATIENTS AND METHODS  To test for a relationship between clinical breast examination and histopathology  we devised separate  4-point scales of clinical density and nodularity and validated these scales by repeat examinations 4 or more months apart in 199 separate breasts  the scale was the same or within 1 point on repeat examination 87  of the time for density and 90  for nodularity . We then used these two clinical scales to compare density and nodularity to histopathology of breast tissue at the margins of segmental resections in 60 women undergoing breast-conserving treatment of primary breast cancer. In cases such as these  a large sample of  normal  tissue is intentionally removed when the wide excision is done to obtain negative margins. Histopathology at the margins was graded according to the consensus panel of the American College of Pathology  as might be expected in women with previous cancer  some higher-risk histopathology was found in 37  of cases. A relationship was sought using Spearman s rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS  Neither clinical breast density  rho   0.16  nor clinical breast nodularity  rho   0.01  related to the presence of high-risk histopathology in the underlying tissue. Interestingly  breast nodularity increased with age  rho   0.28   and clinical density and nodularity were inversely related  rho   -0.28 . CONCLUSION  We conclude that neither clinical breast density nor nodularity correlates with histopathology and that it is unlikely that a larger study would find a clinically useful correlation. Therefore  a clinical examination should not be used to decide that high-risk histopathology is likely to be present in an individual woman s breast.

Human carotid bodies obtained at necropsy that showed prominence of either the sustentacular cell or the dark variant of chief cell or chronic carotid glomitis were studied by an immunogold labeling technique. The peptides methionine and leucine enkephalin had a similar distribution to that found in the normal human carotid body. They were localized prominently and predominantly in the dark and progenitor variants of chief  type I  cells. The sustentacular  type II  cells showed no immunoreactivity for the enkephalins. Cell counts on immunolabeled chief cells in cases of sustentacular cell hyperplasia and chronic carotid glomitis were found to be at the lower end of the normal range  whereas those in dark cell prominence occurred nearer the upper limit. Khan Q  Smith P  Heath D.Image cytophotometric DNA analysis of atypical hyperplasias and intraductal carcinomas of the breast. With the use of image analysis  DNA content was quantified on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 25 atypical hyperplasias and 35 intraductal carcinomas of the breast by comparison of integrated gray levels of Feulgen-stained control and ductal cell nuclei. The mean full-peak  G0 G1  control cell DNA histogram coefficient of variation was 5.5 . DNA aneuploidy was more common in intraductal carcinomas compared with atypical hyperplasias  71  of intraductal carcinomas vs 36  of atypical hyperplasias  and correlated with a lack of cytologic  nuclear  and architectural differentiation  63  moderate vs 93  poor and 38  cribriform vs 82  solid . In addition  multiple DNA stemlines were observed in 40  of intraductal carcinomas. We conclude that  1  some atypical hyperplasias demonstrate abnormal DNA content consistent with neoplastic transformation   2  aggressive forms of intraductal carcinoma are more frequently associated with DNA content abnormalities  and  3  frequent DNA stemline heterogeneity in intraductal carcinoma supports the hypothesis that multiple genetic events occur in the development of mammary intraepithelial neoplasia. Crissman JD  Visscher DW  Kubus J.Rurally based education  confronting social forces underlying ill health. Skills needed by physicians to address and prevent our communities  leading causes of premature death--injuries  cancer  cardiovascular disease  homicide  and suicide--are not in the typical roster of medical school learning experiences. And traditional  urban  hospital-based venues of medical education scarcely model for students appealing careers in the community. These twin problems are especially severe in rural America. Yet rural training sites are ideal locations for students to confront the array of social  political  and economic forces underlying ill health in our society. If learning in medical schools is to be suitable for rural practice  students must receive early and sustained exposure to rural communities and to rural physician role models. To facilitate this educational redirection  medical schools must  1  sensitize their existing faculty and residents to community health needs via in-service training on community health topics   2  encourage faculty and residents to provide service and education outreach to rural communities  and  3  promote rural health research. Finally  to prevent the marginalization of rural health concerns within the academic agenda  efforts should be made to develop university-community partnerships in which model rural training practices and a  field  teaching faculty are established and nourished by the medical center. Kaufman A.Effect of complement and arachidonic acid pathway inhibition on white blood cell count and deposition on vascular grafts. To determine the role of complement and arachidonic acid metabolites in the decrease in peripheral white blood cell count  pWBC  observed with graft implantation  Dacron aortic grafts were implanted in control rabbits  Group I  n   13   or rabbits pretreated with cobra venom factor  80 U kg  to deplete complement  Group II  n   13   indomethacin  2.5 mg kg  to inhibit cyclooxygenase  Group III  n   7   or diethylcarbamazine  DEC  90 mg kg  to inhibit leukotriene synthesis  Group IV  n   7 . pWBC was measured 15 min and 1 hr after graft implantation. After graft removal  the WBC count on grafts  gWBC  was determined by light microscopy  LM  and scanning electron microscopy  SEM . One hr after graft implantation  pWBC decreased significantly in Groups I-IV to 46   52   40   and 45  of preoperative pWBC  respectively. There was no significant difference among the groups. LM revealed gWBC per 63x field of 8.0  12.3  5.8  and 6.8 in Groups I-IV  respectively. Similarly  SEM showed gWBC per 2000x field of 2.5  5.6  0.7  and 1.5 in Groups I-IV  respectively. SEM gWBC was significantly greater in Group II than I  p less than 0.01   and significantly less in Group III than I  p less than 0.05 . Results suggested that complement and arachidonic acid pathways alone do not affect the fall in pWBC  but may influence gWBC.

In the UK Trial for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer in Nottingham  119 women were identified as having fibrocystic change with epithelial hyperplasia or in situ carcinoma. Their mammograms were classified according to Wolfe s criteria and the corresponding histology for each patient was classified for degrees of epithelial hyperplasia  atypia and in situ neoplasia using Page s criteria. A control population of patients presenting for breast screening was used to represent the general population. No correlation was found between the four mammographic Wolfe patterns  N1  P1  P2 and DY and histological evidence of epithelial hyperplasia  atypia or in situ carcinoma. A further study was carried out to determine histological features of Wolfe pattern  using radiological examination of resected breast tissue. The variation in Wolfe pattern was related to the distribution of fibrous and adipose tissue in the breast interlobular stroma and appeared to have no relationship to epithelial parenchymal content. This information does not support the hypothesis that radiographic densities of P2 and DY patterns correspond to high risk epithelial proliferation.

To study the effects of dietary fat on jejunal water and ion absorption and on cholera toxin-induced secretion  3 week old Sprague Dawley rats were fed isocaloric diets. Forty per cent of the total calories were given as fat  as butter  high saturated fat   olive oil  high monounsaturated fat   or corn oil  high polyunsaturated fat   with one group on low fat  10  of calories  standard laboratory diet as controls. During in vivo jejunal perfusion studies we found that  i  a polyunsaturated fat  corn oil  supplemented diet improves jejunal absorption of water and electrolytes and these changes are independent of the observed concentrations of luminal prostaglandins   ii  high dietary fat appreciably reduced the secretory response to cholera toxin  probably without fundamentally changing the mechanism by which cholera toxin induces secretion. We conclude that dietary fat composition altered the permeability and transport characteristics of the small intestine. This observation might have relevance to some human diarrhoeal disorders.

Carr EM  Heilman E  Prose NS.Parasympathetic nervous system activity in hypothyroidism determined by R-R interval variations on electrocardiogram. Little is known about the relationship between hypothyroidism and the parasympathetic nervous system. R-R interval variations revealed by electrocardiogram  ECG  are known to be a useful clinical indicator of abnormalities of parasympathetic nervous system activity. Studies were conducted in hypothyroid patients  and significant reductions in R-R interval variations were observed in patients with primary severe hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto s thyroiditis  and in patients with Graves  disease who became severely hypothyroid during antithyroid drug therapy. R-R interval variations were restored to normal levels in both groups of patients after treatment. The present investigation suggests that in marked hypothyroidism there are hypofunctional abnormalities in the parasympathetic nervous system in association with a reduction in the levels of serum T4 and T3.

Johnson BA  Poses RM  Fortner CA  Meier FA  Dalton HP.Aldosterone synthesis in salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasia with complete absence of adrenal 21-hydroxylase. BACKGROUND. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is a disorder of cortisol and aldosterone biosynthesis that results from mutations in the CYP21 gene encoding the adrenal 21-hydroxylase P-450c21. It can cause severe salt wasting in newborns that requires long-term treatment with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. We describe a spontaneous partial recovery from this disorder in a 19-year-old woman who had discontinued treatment. METHODS. We measured plasma and urinary levels of adrenal hormones  plasma renin activity  and sodium balance longitudinally in the patient and four other patients in whom adrenal hyperplasia had been diagnosed in infancy and in whom DNA analysis had predicted a complete absence of functional P-450c21. The ratio of plasma renin activity to urinary aldosterone was used as a measure of the response of the adrenal zona glomerulosa. Two patients underwent intravenous infusion of  3H progesterone for the measurement of extraadrenal production of 21-hydroxylated precursors of aldosterone. RESULTS. The patient who had discontinued her medication excreted a normal amount of aldosterone  20.0 nmol per square meter of body-surface area per day  while following a diet low in sodium. Her ratio of plasma renin activity to urinary aldosterone-18-glucuronide excretion was 1.7 after three days of sodium restriction  as compared with a ratio of 4.7 at the age of nine years  normal range  0.03 to 0.1 . The percentage of extraadrenal conversion of progesterone to deoxycorticosterone was low. The four other patients had variable responses to sodium restriction after the neonatal period  range for plasma renin activity urinary aldosterone-18-glucuronide  1.9 to 19.4 . CONCLUSIONS. Although patients with salt-wasting 21-hydroxylase deficiency have functionally equivalent mutations in their CYP21 genes  they may vary from one another and over time in their ability to produce mineralocorticoids. This variation may be attributable to another adrenal enzyme with 21-hydroxylase activity.

Women with polycystic ovarian disease and hyperthecosis have hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. It is possible that insulin in supraphysiologic concentration exerts its steroidogenic action on ovarian stromal cells through insulin-like growth factor I receptors. We undertook this study to investigate whether the ovarian stroma of women with hyperthecosis has specific binding sites for insulin or insulin-like growth factor I. Ovarian stromal tissue was obtained from seven women with normal ovulatory cycles and from five women with hyperthecosis of the ovaries. Binding studies with insulin tagged with iodine 125 and insulin-like growth factor I tagged with iodine 125 revealed specific binding sites both for insulin and insulin-like growth factor I in the ovarian stroma. The binding of insulin tagged with iodine 125 in the ovarian stroma of women with hyperthecosis  3.4    - 1.1     - SE  per 100 micrograms protein  was significantly  p less than 0.04  lower than that observed in normal premenopausal women  8.3    - 1.6  per 100 micrograms protein . By contrast  the specific binding of insulin-like growth factor I tagged with iodine 125 in the ovarian stroma of women with hyperthecosis  7.1    - 1.7  per 100 micrograms protein  was higher than that observed in the ovarian stroma from normal women  4.5    - 1.7  per 100 micrograms protein   although the difference was not statistically significant. The affinity constants for these high-affinity receptors were similar  1.2 to 3.6 x 10 9  L mol  in the two groups of women. These results indicate that  1  the ovarian stroma has specific binding sites both for insulin and for insulin-like growth factor I   2  in women with hyperthecosis  the ovarian stroma has decreased binding sites for insulin but has normal concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I receptors  and  3  in women with hyperthecosis  stimulation of ovarian androgen synthesis by insulin may be mediated through the insulin-like growth factor I receptors.

The human serologic response to several envelope-associated proteins and adenylate cyclase toxin of Bordetella pertussis was examined using immunoblot techniques. Antigens recognized by sera from individuals with culture-confirmed pertussis and by sera from infants immunized with three doses of conventional whole-cell pertussis vaccine included a 63 000-Da protein that was shown to be antigenically related to a mycobacterial heat-shock protein. A 29 000-Da protein reacted with sera from convalescent individuals  whereas a 91 000-Da protein reacted with sera from vaccinated individuals. Antibodies to adenylate cyclase toxin were common in sera from individuals diagnosed with pertussis. B. pertussis lipooligosaccharide was also recognized by antibodies in some of these sera. These data suggest that some of these antigens may play a role in immunity to pertussis.

During direct surgery of neoplastic and vascular lesions of the cavernous sinus  the intracavernous carotid artery may be injured beyond repair  or its total isolation may be necessary for surgical management of these lesions. The newly developed procedure of a saphenous vein graft bypass of the cavernous carotid artery allows re-establishment of carotid circulation. Patients with poor collateral circulation are at high risk for ischemic complications induced by the prolonged temporary occlusion required to perform the bypass graft. Optimal management of these patients is to perform the venous bypass graft for permanent vascularization while maintaining carotid cerebral circulation through an intraoperative shunt. We studied this procedure in cadavers  and three shunt types were evaluated  the external intrapetrous-supraclinoid shunt  Type A   the internal intrapetrous-supraclinoid shunt  Type B   and the neck internal carotid-supraclinoid shunt  Type C . Anatomical landmarks  techniques  distances  caliber  and materials used are presented. The rationale and candidates for such a procedure are discussed. The specifications of an optimal balloon shunt are presented  and the three procedures are compared. al-Mefty O  Khalil N  Elwany MN  Smith RR.Comment  clinical education in Rhode Island  letter  comment  Luzzi LA.Single-dose therapy for esophageal candidiasis with fluconazole  letter  Chave JP  Francioli P  Hirschel B  Glauser MP.Premature escape beats in vitro and in vivo  letter  comment  Gorgels AP  Vos MA  Wellens HJ.Partial gastric corpectomy results in hypergastrinemia and development of gastric enterochromaffinlike-cell carcinoids in the rat. Studies in the rat have shown that partial gastric corpectomy  in which about 75  of the acid-producing oxyntic mucosa was removed  leads to markedly reduced acid secretion and a feedback increase in the plasma gastrin levels. Ten weeks after operation  the gastric enterochromaffin  ECL -like cell density in the remaining part of the oxyntic mucosa had increased significantly. In the present study  the effects on the gastric ECL cells of lifelong persistent hypergastrinemia induced by partial  75   corpectomy have been investigated. Seventy-five partially corpectomized rats and 40 control rats were investigated for plasma gastrin and oxyntic mucosal changes in a 124-week study. The partially corpectomized rats showed increased plasma gastrin levels after the operation  the mean increase compared with the controls was almost 10-fold during the entire study. The remaining oxyntic mucosa of the partially corpectomized rats differed from that of control rats in two respects  showing first general hypertrophy and second a marked hyperplasia of argyrophil ECL cells. The degree and incidence of these changes increased towards the end of the study  i.e.  in the aging rats. An age-related increase in ECL-cell density occurred spontaneously also in the control rats but to a lesser extent than in the partially corpectomized group. ECL-cell carcinoids were found in the oxyntic mucosa of 26 of the 75 partially corpectomized rats. The first carcinoid was found 78 weeks after the beginning of the study. Six rats with carcinoids  23   were found before week 104  2 years  and the remainder  20  77    were discovered later. No carcinoid tumor was found in the control rats. It is concluded that lifelong hypergastrinemia induced by partial corpectomy leads to the development of ECL-cell carcinoids in the oxyntic mucosa of some rats towards the end of their life span. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that the gastric ECL-cell carcinoids found in rats treated with antisecretory drugs are caused by long-standing hypergastrinemia developing secondary to inhibition of gastric acid secretion.

Based on our findings that changes in wall shear stress  not the rate of blood flow  were the main hemodynamic factor related to intimal hyperplasia of autologous vein grafts  we further investigated the effect of wall shear stress variation on sequential ultrastructural changes in the intimal hyperplasia of arterially transplanted autovein grafts  using canine models. As noted  wall shear stress variation  tau-variation  could be defined by the variation in wall shear stress within a cardiac cycle  using a desktop flow waveform analyzer. In Group I  which had a high flow rate of 78.4   - 4.6 ml min and low tau-variation of 36.1   - 2.2 dynes cm2  intimal hyperplasia was significant. Ultrastructurally  there was a marked transformation of intimal smooth muscle cells to secretory cells 2 to 4 weeks after implantation. The surface of the intima was lined with modified smooth muscle cells at 2 weeks after implantation. In Group II  which had a low flow rate of 5.6   - 2.2 ml min and normal tau-variation value  174.6   - 13.0 dynes cm2   intimal hyperplasia was minimal  and there were several layers of contractile type smooth muscle cells  with characteristic myofibrillae. The surface of the intima was lined with endothelial cells at 2 weeks after implantation. These findings suggest that  in regions of low wall shear stress variation  intimal smooth muscle cells of autovein grafts may well become secretory cells  and enhanced platelet adherence could occur during early intimal repair  causing intimal hyperplasia to develop.

Partial myoepithelial differentiation is common in simple epithelial hyperplasia  epitheliosis  of the breast but functional myoepithelial differentiation with basement membrane production is exceedingly rare. A peculiar change of hyaline globules within benign epithelial hyperplasia has been recognised before as  collagenous spherulosis  and type IV collagen has been shown by immunohistochemistry. Another seven cases are described which show the presence of laminin and collagens IV and III within the proliferation. Electron microscopy examination of two cases using material retrieved from the wax block showed varying degrees of myoepithelial differentiation of the cells immediately surrounding the spherules and basal lamina material  including mature collagen fibrils in one case. The degree of myoepithelial differentiation of the cells surrounding the spherules seemed to correlate with the differing types and amounts of extracellular matrix in the spherule. Histopathologists should be aware of this rare change as it may be misinterpreted as in situ carcinoma.

To characterize mutations in the CYP21B gene that are responsible for congenital adrenal hyperplasia  CAH   DNA samples from 91 French patients have been studied by allelic-specific oligonucleotide hybridization and Southern blot analysis. Seven sites mostly found in the CYP21A pseudogene and deletions of the functional CYP21B gene have been screened. Gene conversions involving small DNA segments accounted for 57  of the tested mutations and probably cause 74  of the mutations responsible for the disease. Complete deletion of the CYP21B gene accounted for 18  of the CAH mutations in the whole sample and for 21  in the classical form of the disease. Three mutations were found associated with specific clinical forms of the disease  a G-C substitution in the seventh exon was associated with the late-onset form of the disease  and both an 8-bp depletion in the third exon and complete deletion of CYP21B were associated with the salt-wasting form.

The effect of blood transfusions and anesthesia on host response to endotoxin was evaluated in multiple Lewis rat models. The rats were randomized to receive A Sogaloff Cancer Institute rat blood  pentobarbital sodium  or lactated Ringer s solution and  at either 2 or 7 days following administration of these agents  were challenged with intravenous endotoxin. Neither blood transfusions nor anesthesia altered mortality when administered 2 days before endotoxin challenge. However  blood transfusions administered 7 days before endotoxin challenge were found to prolong survival  to prevent endotoxin-induced alterations in T-lymphocyte subsets  and to decrease plasma tumor necrosis factor levels. In conclusion  blood transfusions appear to depress immune function in a beneficial manner in endotoxin shock.

Pigmented villonodular synovitis is an uncommon benign lesion that is characterized by diffuse synovial proliferation. Based on animal models  this lesion has been conjectured previously to be reactive in nature. In this report  the authors present the histologic and cytogenetic findings for a pigmented villonodular synovitis that was excised from the right knee of a 47-year-old man. Trisomy 7 was observed in 24 of 75  35   metaphases obtained from short-term culture of cells from this tumor. These findings suggest that some cases of pigmented villonodular synovitis represent clonal  neoplastic proliferations.

A biomechanical  biochemical  and morphological study in dogs. The effect of an elapsed interval of time between injury and operative repair of the flexor tendons was investigated in a canine model. Transected intrasynovial flexor tendons were repaired either immediately or after a delay of seven or twenty-one days. The biomechanical  biochemical  and morphological characteristics were compared at three and six weeks. The values for angular rotation  linear excursion  ultimate load  and linear slope were determined  concentrations of collagen and reducible collagen cross-links  an index of newly synthesized collagen  were measured  and the ultrastructural morphology of the tendons was examined by high-voltage electron microscopy. For the tendons that were repaired immediately  the values for angular rotation were 9.4   - 3.2 and 13.0   - 3.7 degrees at three and six weeks  for those that were repaired at seven days  4.1   - 1.3 and 2.5   - 1.4 degrees  and for those that were repaired at twenty-one days  2.7   - 0.8 and 4.7   - 0.7 degrees. There was a significant effect of the delay until repair on the angular rotation and linear excursion in all three groups  p less than 0.005 for both . Tensile testing of the bone-tendon complex revealed no significant effect of the delay on the values for ultimate load  p greater than 0.05 . There were no significant differences in total concentration of collagen at the sites of repair or in the levels of reducible Schiff-base cross-links  indicators of newly synthesized cross-links  in tendons from the three groups.

A patient with pernicious anemia developed severe intractable diarrhea night and day. Investigation revealed chronic atrophic gastritis and a markedly elevated level of serum gastrin. No obvious explantation for the diarrhea was found  but after antrectomy  the gastrin level returned to normal and the diarrhea subsided. Possible mechanisms for an association between diarrhea and hypergastrinemia include colonic hypermotility secondary to release of acetylcholine and inhibition of fluid and electrolyte reabsorption within the small bowel.

SETTING  A Veterans Affairs medical center. INTERVENTIONS  The policy made lovastatin available to physicians when failure of therapy with diet and two first-line drugs was documented on an order form. The form also contained educational information including prices and recommended niacin as the drug treatment of first choice for most patients. DESIGN  To evaluate the effect of the policy  lipid-lowering drug use at the medical center was compared with that at a similar center that did not restrict lovastatin use  and with lipid-lowering drug use in the United States as a whole. A written questionnaire was used to survey physician reaction to the policy. RESULTS  The use of lovastatin as a percentage of total lipid-lowering drug use at the center with the lovastatin policy was one-fourth that at the other center or nationwide  and the use of niacin was four times greater  p less than 0.0001 . The estimated savings in drug costs to the center with the lovastatin policy due to these differences was more than $30 000 per year. In the survey of physicians affected by the policy  n   78  response rate   100    less than one-fourth viewed it unfavorably  and 90  favored this policy over restricting the drug to a subspecialty clinic. CONCLUSION  The authors  experience indicates that a formulary policy that permits limited use of an expensive drug in a primary care setting can contain costs in a way that is acceptable to physicians. A policy of this type could be useful to the increasing number of health care provider organizations that cover the cost of outpatient medications.

Tender hepatomegaly and ascites occurred in a young woman receiving cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin for acute myelogenous leukemia. Whereas veno-occlusive disease was suspected clinically  liver biopsy showed nodular regenerative hyperplasia with no evidence of hepatic vein abnormalities. It is postulated that nodular regenerative hyperplasia can be initiated by hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy agents used to treat leukemia and or that these agents exacerbate clinical manifestations of this histological abnormality. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia should be added to the list of liver problems occurring in patients with leukemia.

This article addresses general and specific aspects of dietary sodium interventions from the perspective of behavioral change. Changing dietary behavior requires relearning a range of habitual behaviors involved in day-to-day eating situations in the context of a diverse and complex food supply and in consideration of numerous factors  other than health concerns  that influence habitual eating patterns. Potential obstacles to dietary sodium reduction relate to the wide distribution of sodium in foods  the strong cultural values for salt  and the difficulty of assessing success in sodium reduction. A review of sodium interventions reported in the literature suggests that state-of-the-art behavioral change strategies can be effective in achieving reductions in sodium intake to around 3 000 mg day but that this level is achieved only with highly motivated individuals and when a high level of intervention  i.e.  intensive and multifaceted  is provided. Thus  in regard to sodium reduction in the general population  either the goal will have to be modest or the food supply will have to change so that substantial decreases in sodium intake can be accomplished with less intensive and less costly interventions. Kumanyika S.Effect of lovastatin on intimal hyperplasia after balloon angioplasty  a study in an atherosclerotic hypercholesterolemic rabbit. Restenosis  the major limitation of balloon angioplasty  is the result of intimal hyperplasia after the procedure. Lovastatin  a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A  HMG-CoA  inhibitor  may influence intimal hyperplasia by lowering serum cholesterol and by blocking deoxyribonucleic acid  DNA  synthesis. To determine whether lovastatin reduces intimal hyperplasia  a prospective  randomized blinded study was performed in 60 atherosclerotic New Zealand White male rabbits. Atherosclerosis was produced by air desiccation injury followed by a 28 day diet of 2  cholesterol and 6  peanut oil that was terminated before balloon angioplasty was performed. Angioplasty could not be performed in 14 rabbits with bilateral femoral artery occlusion  and in one rabbit the procedure was a technical failure. Forty-five rabbits underwent balloon angioplasty performed with use of a 2.5-mm balloon inflated to 10 atm for three 1 min dilations at 1 min intervals. Seven rabbits died during the procedure. Thirty-eight rabbits were randomized to either a lovastatin group  6 mg kg body weight per day  or a control group. Angioplasty was performed on all patent vessels  n   54   the procedure was bilateral in 16 rabbits and unilateral in 22. Fifteen lovastatin-treated and 15 control rabbits survived 39 days after angioplasty and were then killed. Angiograms  obtained before and 10 min and 39 days after balloon angioplasty  were read with use of electronic calipers by two observers who had no knowledge of treatment data. After the rabbits were killed  vessels were pressure perfused using a standardized protocol to maintain in vivo dimensions for blinded quantitative histologic analysis.

A 37-year-old woman patient  known to have poorly controlled arterial hypertension that was diagnosed following a cerebrovascular accident at the age of 15 years  was referred to our outpatient clinic for investigation in 1987. An intrarenal arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed by selective renal angiography. Embolization of the fistula was performed using four 15-mm 5-cm coils  which induced thrombosis and obstructed the fistula. The vascularization of the affected kidney improved immediately. During the following 4 months  the antihypertensive treatment was stopped gradually  and the patient remained normotensive. This is an unusual case of a large intrarenal arteriovenous fistula  whose etiology was not clear  that was successfully treated by percutaneous embolization. Winkler J  Neuman-Levin M  Boner G.Progression from lymphoid hyperplasia to high-grade malignant lymphoma in mice transgenic for the t 14  18 . Follicular lymphoma  the most common human lymphoma  characteristically has a t 14  18  interchromosomal translocation. It is typically an indolent disease comprised of small resting B cells  but frequently develops into a high-grade lymphoma. The t 14  18  translocates the Bcl-2 gene  generating a deregulated Bcl-2-immunoglobulin fusion gene. Bcl-2 is a novel inner mitochondrial membrane protein that extends the survival of certain cells by blocking programmed cell death. To determine the oncogenic potential of the t 14  18  translocation  we produced transgenic mice bearing a Bcl-2-immunoglobulin minigene that structurally mimicked the t 14  18 . An indolent follicular hyperplasia in these transgenic mice progressed to a malignant diffuse large-cell lymphoma. The long latency  progression from polyclonal to monoclonal disease  and histological conversion  are all suggestive of secondary changes. Half of the immunoblastic high-grade lymphomas had a rearranged c-myc gene. Our transgenic mice provide an animal model for tumour progression in t 14  18  lymphoma and show that prolonged B-cell life increases tumour incidence.

Latex agglutination  LA  was compared with counterimmunoelectrophoresis  CIE  for the diagnosis of pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae type b in children less than 6 years old in Papua New Guinea. Neither LA nor CIE was sufficiently sensitive for the detection of pneumococcal antigens. CIE was superior to LA but had a sensitivity of only 60   six of 10  in concentrated urine and a specificity of 90   54 of 60 . LA for the detection of H. influenzae type b had a sensitivity of 100   eight of eight  relative to that of blood culture and a specificity of 99   112 of 113  when urine diluted fivefold was tested  as compared with a sensitivity of 100   nine of nine  and a specificity of 92   56 of 61  in undiluted urine. Undiluted and concentrated urine specimens were unsuitable for LA because of the many false-positive reactions that resulted from nasal carriage of H. influenzae type b and nasal carriage of the cross-reactive S. pneumoniae type 6. CIE for the detection of H. influenzae type b had a sensitivity of only 44   four of nine  in concentrated urine. Witt CS  Montgomery JM  Pomat W  Lehmann D  Alpers MP.Phenotypic relationships of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive prostatic carcinoma. Thirty-one snap-frozen human prostate specimens containing examples of benign hyperplasia  prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia  PIN   and invasive carcinoma were analyzed using a panel of 24 antibodies and one lectin. Twenty-seven additional routinely processed radical prostatectomy specimens were studied using selected probes known to work on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. Three probes  anticytokeratin KA4  anti-vimentin V9  and the lectin from Ulex europaeus  UEA-1   demonstrated phenotypic similarities between PIN and invasive carcinoma. Whereas the luminal cells of normal or hyperplastic prostatic epithelium are minimally reactive with KA4  4   or UEA-1  0   and strongly reactive with anti-vimentin  91    both the PIN and invasive carcinoma are reactive with KA4  89  and 93   respectively  and UEA-1  96  and 93   respectively  and minimally reactive with anti-vimentin  15  and 0   respectively . The increased KA4 staining was shown to be in part due to detection of cytokeratin 19  by using cytokeratin-19-specific antibodies  4.62 and LP2K. The reasons for the increased expression of this cytokeratin and the decreased expression of vimentin are unclear but seem to indicate a phenotypic relationship between the PIN lesions and invasive carcinoma.

Post-resectional hyperplasia is the phenomenon in which residual small bowel increases in size and absorptive capacity after segmental enterectomy. This experiment studied the effect of somatostatin analogue therapy on the development of two structural parameters of post-resectional hyperplasia in rats subjected to 40  proximal small bowel resection. Octreotide acetate-treated rats failed to develop increased villus height  902   - 50 microns  relative to saline-treated rats  1 103   - 98 microns . Augmentation of residual intestinal weight was also significantly impaired in analogue-treated rats  92   - 3 versus 118   - 5 mg cm . We conclude that somatostatin analogue treatment during the early postoperative period does impair the growth of residual bowel in rats. These findings raise concern regarding the use of this drug for postoperative patients who have undergone massive small bowel resection in whom the process of post-resectional adaptation may be critical to allow sustenance with enteral nutrition. Bass BL  Fischer BA  Richardson C  Harmon JW.We cannot afford an AIDS epidemic  see comments  Dodwell S.Plasma fibronectin levels during cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma fibronectin  also called cold-insoluble globulin  is a cryoprecipitable glycoprotein with both opsonic and adhesive activities. It binds to collagen  actin  and heparin and can form soluble as well as cryoprecipitable complexes in the cold. Fibronectin augments particulate phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system and can influence lung vascular permeability. Plasma fibronectin deficiency is temporally associated with respiratory failure in septic surgical  trauma  and burn patients. We measured plasma fibronectin and albumin levels in nine adults undergoing elective cardiopulmonary bypass to determine whether dilution alone could account for the changes in plasma fibronectin. Plasma fibronectin concentration decreased 17  with the surgical trauma of opening of the chest and placement of the vascular cannulas. On heparinization and initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass  plasma fibronectin fell an additional 48   P less than 0.001   whereas albumin concentration  corrected for albumin in the pump prime  fell only 25   P less than 0.001   emphasizing that dilution was not the only mechanism contributing to the decline in plasma fibronectin. Fibronectin levels began to increase after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass and in association with diuresis  but unexpectedly they remained subnormal until 4 days postoperation. Thus the decline in fibronectin concentration with cardiopulmonary bypass may be due to dilution as well as opsonic consumption and possible complexing with heparin in the cold.

The potassium analog  rubidium-82  82Rb   is extracted after i.v. injection and retained in viable myocardium but is not trapped or washed out of necrotic regions. To compare myocardial cell metabolism with membrane dysfunction as indicators of necrosis viability  43 patients with evolving myocardial infarction and coronary arteriography had positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose  FDG  and the potassium analog 82Rb. Percent of heart showing FDG defects and 82Rb washout on sequential images indicating failure to retain the potassium analogue were visually assessed and quantified by automated software. Infarct size based on rubidium kinetics correlated closely with size and location on FDG images  visual r   0.93  automated r   0.82   suggesting that loss of cell membrane integrity for trapping the potassium analog 82Rb parallels loss of intracellular glucose metabolism  both comparable quantitative markers of myocardial necrosis viability.

Improvement of back extensor strength  BES  can be used as a therapeutic method for patients with chronic back pain and osteoporosis. The method of evaluation must be reliable and accurate without compromising the condition of the patient. We report the development of a back isometric dynamometer  BID-2000  designed specifically by two of us to address these concerns in elderly patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis. As the demographics of the general population change  increasing numbers of patients will need the type of monitoring that the BID-2000 provides. Aging has been shown to cause a reduction in the number of functional muscle motor units. To examine this effect on BES  we tested 50 normal  healthy women who were 30 to 79 years old. Proper testing of BES in patients with fragile vertebrae should include isometric measurement in the prone position  maneuverability of the device to allow comfortable positioning of the patient  and simplicity of technique to minimize repetitious performance of maximal contraction. The BID-2000 incorporates each of these features and also provides meaningful results inexpensively. The device offers a safe  reliable  coefficient of variation   2.33    and valid  P   0.001  method of evaluation. The results of our study demonstrated moderate  steady reduction of BES with increasing age and with each successive decade.

A case of elevation of the petrous bone due to hyperplasia of the occipital bone presenting as hemifacial spasm is reported. A 44-year-old man sought treatment for twitching of the buccal muscles on the right side that progressed rapidly in severity within 2 weeks of the onset. The anatomical details of the petrous and occipital bones were delineated clearly by computed tomographic scans of a bone window level. Details of the brain stem were shown by magnetic resonance images. The bone anomaly was displayed more realistically by three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstructions. The faithful representation of structures with these radiological studies should be mandatory  to prepare the surgical planning of such a complicated bone anomaly.

The posterior mandible begins just behind the mental nerve and second bicuspid bilaterally  extends to the posterior edge of the ramus  and then runs superiorly to the zygomatic arch. Augmentation of the posterior mandible is possible by use of a synthetic implant that is tailored individually to each patient s specific needs. Implant plant thickness varies from 4 to 8 mm  with an average thickness of 6 mm. Careful preoperative planning is done based on an aesthetic assessment of the amount of highlighting desired  thickness of the soft tissues  and the use of life-size photographs and cephalometric and Panorex x-rays. A pattern is cut  and the implant is carved to fit the patient. Insertion of the material after careful tailoring to the individual patient s own mandibular size and configuration requires a generous posterior lower buccal sulcus incision. Antibiotic irrigation and systemic antibiotics are essential  and careful closure in two layers completes the procedure. One implant in the series extruded in a patient who had had radiation therapy  and one patient required repositioning of the implant. Otherwise  in 22 patients there were no infections or permanent morbidity. The procedure seems to be a realistic and safe one for both the youthful and aging face  as demonstrated in patients in this series  with ages varying from 16 to 40 years.

Day 1 LCAT activity  78.2 mumol.L-1.h-1  was decreased with respect to day 10  139.2 mumol.L-1.h-1  P less than 0.001  and day 30  108.0 mumol.L-1.h-1  P   0.08 . Plasma total cholesterol  TC   cholesterol ester  CE   and lipoprotein CEs  VLDL  IDL  LDL  and HDL  were reduced relative to days 10 and 30  P less than 0.001 . Before treatment HDL composition was abnormal. On days 1  10  and 30  the respective mean HDL-apolipoprotein A-I  apo A-I  concentrations were 23.33  39.66  and 36.08 mumol L. LDL-apo B concentrations were 0.40  0.68  and 0.56 mumol L  P less than 0.01  days 10 and 30 vs day 1 . LDL particles on day 1 were decreased in number  depleted of CE  and laden with triacylglycerol and surface lipids. LCAT activity on day 1 correlated with LDL-CE linoleate  P less than 0.05  r   0.48 . Reduced plasma LCAT activity is an important factor related to abnormalities in lipoprotein composition and concentrations.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of interpleural bupivacaine on analgesia and ventilatory capacity after cholecystectomy. Forty-two patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to two groups  one to receive interpleural administration of bupivacaine-adrenaline mixture  Group 1   22 patients  and the other standard administration of intramuscular meperidine  Group 2   20 patients  for postoperative pain relief. The intensity of pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale  VAS  preoperatively as well as at 2  8  24 and 48 hr postoperatively. At the same time  FVC and FEV1.0 measurements were obtained for all patients. The group given interpleural bupivacaine had better pain relief with mean VAS of 0.6   - 0.9  mean   - SD  1.1   - 1.4  0.6   - 0.9 and 0.8   - 1.2 compared with 5.2   - 2.2  5.8   - 2.7  5.5   - 2.2 and 4.5   - 1.8 for patients receiving meperidine  P less than 0.001 . The patients in Group 1 also had larger FVC and FEV than those in Group 2  FVC 22   - 14.5 per cent vs 32   - 15.2 per cent  P less than 0.005   FEV1.0 25   - 15.5 vs 38   - 14.8 per cent  P less than 0.001   mean   - SD . We conclude that the interpleural analgesia can achieve better pain relief with greater ventilatory capacity than a standard analgesic regimen in the first two days after cholecystectomy.

Renal dysfunction is a frequent consequence of cyclosporine administration  even when cyclosporine blood concentrations are maintained within proper therapeutic levels. As dermatologic indications for this compound expand  it is important for clinicians to understand the relevant pharmacology and physiology that underlie cyclosporine-induced renal dysfunction. This article reviews the clinical pharmacology of cyclosporine  the principles of renal function testing  and the clinical manifestations of this drug s effects on the kidney. Sudden declines in kidney function  long-term cyclosporine nephrotoxicity  hemolytic-uremic syndrome  and hypertension are discussed from a clinical and experimental standpoint. Finally  practical suggestions are provided to aid the dermatologist in managing cyclosporine-treated patients.

A multiparameter approach. Forty-six fine-needle aspirates of lymphoproliferative lesions from 31 human immunodeficiency virus  HIV -positive patients were reviewed using cytomorphologic  immunocytochemical  flow cytometric  FCM   cytogenetic  and molecular studies. There were 29 lymphomas  15 small non-cleaved cell  SNCL   11 large cell  LCL   one small lymphocytic  and two Hodgkin s   14 reactive hyperplasias  and three  atypical lymphoid proliferations.  The reactive hyperplasias were characteristically polymorphic and polyclonal lymphoid populations  six of seven were diploid on FCM  the seventh was hypodiploid. Higher proliferative indices  mean  11.6   and higher RNA indices  mean  1.2  characterized this subgroup compared with published reactive lymphoid hyperplasias from patients without HIV positivity. Aspirates of SNCL showed monotonous populations of intermediate-sized cells except in one patient where a giant cell syncytial variant occurred. Nine of 13 SNCL aspirates showed light chain restriction. JH rearrangement revealed B-cell lineage in one aspirate in which immunocytochemical study was negative for Kappa  lambda  B1  and Leu-4. Nine of 12 SNCL were diploid  the mean proliferative index was 25.6  and the mean RNA index 2.3. Chromosomal translocations involving the c-myc locus were demonstrated in five of seven SNCL aspirates karyotyped. Five of eight LCL showed light chain restriction the remaining three showed null cell phenotype. Large cell lymphomas were diploid on tetraploid with the mean proliferative index of 22.0  and mean RNA index of 2.2. One of two LCL aspirates karyotyped demonstrated c-myc translocation. Despite the multiparameter approach  a definitive diagnosis could not be reached in three aspirates.

Plasma cell granuloma is a rare  benign tumor most commonly found in the lungs in patients younger than 30 years. Although presentation has been reported at a number of other anatomic sites  this report is the first of plasma cell granuloma of the nasal cavity. The tumor was initially resected  but progression was seen at 1-month follow-up. Because further surgery to completely eradicate the tumor would have been extensive and disfiguring  40-Gy external beam radiation was given in 20 fractions using a three-field wedge technique. Most recent clinical follow-up at 27 months showed local control. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for plasma cell granuloma when the disease can be completely resected. However  irradiation can also be effective in patients with recurrent or inoperable local disease.

Forty-six cases of resected lung cancer  including 20 cases at Stages I and II and 26 cases at Stage III  N2   were subdivided into two groups  a good prognosis group with a longer survival period and a poor prognosis group in which the patients died earlier of the cancer. From paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues of these patients  the authors examined DNA histogram pattern and DNA content  using flow cytometry  and histologic hyperplasia of germinal center and paracortical area  they also evaluated their correlation with the prognosis. In the good prognosis group at Stages I and II  paracortical hyperplasia  PH  of the lymph nodes was observed significantly more frequently. In the good prognosis group at Stage III  the incidence of PH  G2M phase in the DNA histograms  and DNA content were all significantly higher. DNA content was positively correlated with the grade of PH. Ogawa J  Iwazaki M  Tsurumi T  Inoue H  Shohtsu A.Educational policies. It is vital that teachers  parents  and health professionals recognize the major educational problems that affect students with epilepsy. Children with epilepsy should be placed in the least restrictive schooling environment so that social  emotional  and educational requirements can be met in a setting best suited to the individual s present needs and future development. Personal assessment and monitoring of progress form an equally important part of a child s educational program in integrated schools  but there is a need to develop suitable instruments to assist teachers in their assessments and decision making. In Australia  the National Epilepsy Association has developed an  Alert Kit  based on the Epilepsy Foundation of Americas  School Alert Kit  to provide basic medical information on epilepsy to teachers and pupils.

GH-binding proteins  GH-BPs  in human blood theoretically may interfere with measurements of immunoreactive GH by forming complexes with GH and competing with antibody reagents for ligand. Indeed  results of serum GH obtained by immunoassays are known to differ markedly depending on the assay employed. To assess the potential role of circulating GH-BPs in this phenomenon  we systematically examined their effect on GH measurement in four RIAs and two immunoradiometric assays. In all except one RIA  the effect of the BPs on tracer binding to antibody was mildly inhibitory. In both immunoradiometric assays  BPs increased the nonspecific association of the tracer with the solid phase reagent. However  these effects were minor at the BP concentrations realistically encountered in practice. Furthermore  the impact of BPs on GH standard curves and final results was negligible because BP effects fall into the category of nonspecific or zero dose counts  which are subtracted during data reduction. We conclude that GH-BPs are only a minor disturbance in GH immunoassays  which is completely compensated for by conventional assay design. Disparities among results yielded by different assays are probably not due to BP interference. Jan T  Shaw MA  Baumann G.The lovastatin-treated rodent  a new model of barrier disruption and epidermal hyperplasia. Recent studies have linked epidermal cholesterol synthesis with maintenance of the permeability barrier. To assess directly the importance of cholesterol synthesis  we applied lovastatin  a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis  to hairless mouse skin. Transepidermal water loss  TEWL  began to increase after four to six daily applications. Co-application of cholesterol blocked the expected increase in TEWL  demonstrating the importance of cholesterol for development of the lesion. The histology of lovastatin-treated skin revealed epidermal hyperplasia  accompanied by accelerated DNA synthesis. Whereas cholesterol synthesis initially was reduced in lovastatin-treated epidermis  with further treatment cholesterol synthesis normalized  while fatty acid synthesis accelerated greatly. Although the total free sterol content of lovastatin-treated epidermis remained normal  the fatty acid content increased coincident with barrier disruption. Finally  morphologic abnormalities of both lamellar body structure and their deposited  intercellular contents occurred coincident with the emerging biochemical abnormalities. Thus  the abnormal barrier function in this model can be ascribed to an initial inhibition of epidermal sterol synthesis followed by an alteration in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis  leading to an imbalance in stratum corneum lipid composition and abnormal membrane bilayer structure. Feingold KR  Man MQ  Proksch E  Menon GK  Brown BE  Elias PM.Immunopathology of olfactory mucosa following injury to the olfactory bulb. Removal of the olfactory bulb was performed on rats in an attempt to elucidate the processes of olfactory dysfunction following head injury. Degeneration and regeneration of the olfactory mucosa were examined  histopathologically and immunohistochemically. We used antisera to olfactory marker protein  OMP  and neuron specific enolase  NSE  as a marker of the mature olfactory receptor neurons. Following rapid degeneration after bulbectomy  the olfactory receptor neurons regenerated. OMP and NSE containing cells re-appeared 49 days later. However  the cell population of the neuroepithelium did not revert to the numbers observed in the non-operated neuroepithelium  even three months later. The lack of a connection between regenerated axons and the olfactory bulb may result in immature neuronal replacement and reduce the number of olfactory receptor neurons. Inamitsu M  Nakashima T  Uemura T.Enlarged adenoid and adenoidectomy in adults  endoscopic approach and histopathological study. Adenoid enlargement is uncommon in adults and because examination of the nasopharynx by indirect posterior rhinoscopy is inadequate  many cases of enlarged adenoid in adults are misdiagnosed and accordingly maltreated. This study was conducted on 35 cases of enlarged adenoid aged between 20 and 42 years. The nasal endoscope was utilized to identify the adenoid mass. Adenoidectomy under transnasal endoscopic control was performed and all the excised material was sent for histopathological examination. Adenoidectomy resulted in marked improvement in 94 per cent of cases without major complications. Histopathological examination revealed non-specific inflammatory reaction in 15 cases  43 per cent   pure reactive changes  predominantly follicular hyperplasia  in two cases  6 per cent  and mixed pattern in 18 cases  51 per cent . Endoscopic follow-up for an average 17 months identified recurrence in only two patients. It was concluded that enlarged adenoid tissue in adults has some histopathological differences from that in children and adenoidectomy under transnasal endoscopic control is safe and reliable. Kamel RH  Ishak EA.Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a rare condition and is poorly recognized in the otolaryngological literature. The condition is characterized by the appearance of cutaneous nodules within the head and neck region especially around the external ear. Variable lymphadenopathy and peripheral eosinophilia can occur and the condition can mimic neoplasia. It is important to be aware of this disease entity in order to avoid overtreatment. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice  however  this often multilobulated and poorly delineated lesion often precludes initial wide excision and local recurrence is common. We present three cases of this unusual condition and a brief resume of the literature.

In February 1988  an ACOG Committee Opinion substantially revised the classification of forceps operations. The revision addressed two significant shortcomings of the old system  Outlet forceps had been defined too narrowly and midforceps too imprecisely. We now report the results of a prospective study of 357 forceps deliveries classified using each system. Allowing up to 45 degrees of rotation in an outlet forceps delivery did not increase morbidity measured by any criterion. Dividing the old midforceps group by precisely identifying station and rotation permitted greater stratification of the risks of short-term neonatal and maternal morbidity. We conclude that our results validate the 1988 classification scheme.

Geller J.Cytologic identification of clinically occult proliferative breast disease in women with a family history of breast cancer. A cytologic method for sampling the normal breast by fine-needle aspiration  FNA  was used to determine the frequency of clinically inapparent proliferative breast disease  PBD  in women with family histories of breast cancer. The authors attempted to obtain specimens from each quadrant of both breasts in 51 female first-degree relatives of breast cancer patients. The study group had no detectable masses by physical examination or mammography. Samples were prepared on membrane filters  Papanicolaou stained  and evaluated cytomorphologically. Three hundred seventy-eight of 408  92.6   possible quadrants were sampled  cellular material was obtained from 290  76.7   quadrants. PBD was identified in 20 of the 51 women  39.2  . When epithelium was obtained  nuclear area  perimeter  and diameter were measured with the use of computerized image analysis. Nuclei in samples containing atypical hyperplasia showed significant differences in these parameters when compared with cells from samples containing normal epithelium or benign hyperplasia. The authors  findings indicate that FNA sampling and computerized image analysis are useful in the detection and characterization of clinically inapparent PBD. Marshall CJ  Schumann GB  Ward JH  Riding JM  Cannon-Albright L  Skolnick M.Tumor necrosis factor induces apoptosis  programmed cell death  in normal endothelial cells in vitro. Tumor necrosis factor  TNF  is cytotoxic for many tumoral cell lines  whereas normal cells generally are considered resistant to this action. This study shows that this cytokine causes massive death of bovine endothelial cells in primary culture in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Dying cells exhibit all the ultrastructural changes and the inter-nucleosome cleavage of DNA associated with apoptosis or  programmed cell death.  This is the first report clearly showing a direct toxicity of TNF on endothelial cells and demonstrating that this results from the induction of the program of apoptotic death. Our observation raises the possibility that hemorrhagic necrosis in vivo  after treatment with TNF  might involve a direct cytocidal action on endothelial cells of the tumor neovasculature. Robaye B  Mosselmans R  Fiers W  Dumont JE  Galand P.Mucocelelike tumor of the breast associated with atypical ductal hyperplasia or mucinous carcinoma. A clinicopathologic study of seven cases. We studied seven patients with mucocelelike tumors of the breast  known to be benign lesions that may be confused with mucinous carcinomas of the breast. All patients had a palpable mass. Microscopically  the most striking feature was the cystic character of the lesion. The epithelial lining of the cysts was usually flat or cuboidal to low columnar  and mucin pools frequently appeared near the ruptured cysts. Three mucocelelike tumors contained a microscopic focus of mucinous carcinoma. The other tumors had areas of atypical ductal hyperplasia containing abundant intraluminal mucinous materials. The mucin was composed predominantly of neutral and nonsulfated acid mucins whose character was identical to that of those in mucinous carcinoma. Because all mucocelelike tumors in our series were associated with either atypical ductal hyperplasia or carcinoma and because some mucocelelike tumors may indeed be early mucinous carcinomas of the breast  we recommend examination of the entire specimen and careful clinical follow-up.

Attention has been directed recently to appropriate methods for sterilizing tonometers to inactivate the human immunodeficiency virus and other viruses that have been found in tears. Noncontact tonometry  utilizing a brief pulse of pressurized air  is an alternative that avoids the need for sterilization procedures. We used a camera and flash electrically coupled to an American Optical Non-Contact II tonometer  Cambridge Instruments Inc  Cambridge  Mass  or a Keeler Pulsair tonometer  Keeler Instruments Inc  Broomall  Pa  to photograph the corneal profile during tonometry. Most eyes revealed some degree of tear film dehiscence and microaerosol formation. While tears have not been implicated as a source of human immunodeficiency virus infection  the ease with which droplets  potentially contaminated with human immunodeficiency virus and other viruses  are dispersed is disturbing.  Air-puff  tonometry may not be aseptic as previously presumed.

The animals were studied for 4 to 5 hours after administration of shock waves to 1 kidney  the contralateral organ serving as control. Urinary excretion of GAGs was measured on both sides. The patients were studied 0 to 24 and 32 to 56 h after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy  ESWL . In the animals an increased mean urinary excretion of GAGs was observed on both sides  this was more marked in the treated kidney. The increase reflects tissue injury in the exposed kidney induced by the extracorporeal shock waves. No increase in mean urinary excretion of GAGs was observed in the patients.

Angioplasty causes substantial injury to the coronary artery intima and media that is unrecognizable by angiography. On the basis of a substantial body of research in oncology and wound healing  it is hypothesized that restenosis is a manifestation of the general wound healing response expressed specifically in vascular tissue. The temporal response to injury occurs in three characteristic phases  inflammation  granulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. The specific expression of these phases in the coronary artery leads to intimal hyperplasia at 1 to 4 months. The major milestones in the temporal sequence of restenosis are platelet aggregation  inflammatory cell infiltration  release of growth factors  medial smooth muscle cell modulation and proliferation  proteoglycan deposition and extracellular matrix remodeling. Each step has potential inhibitors that could be used for preventive therapy. Resolution of restenosis  however  probably requires both creation of the largest possible residual lumen and substantial inhibition of intimal hyperplasia.

Specimens from vulvar carcinomas and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia  VIN  of various degrees were analyzed for the presence of herpes simplex virus 2  HSV 2  and human papillomavirus  HPV  genetic information. A search for the HPV 16 E6 protein as well as the HSV 2 antigenic determinant LA1 and ICSP 11 12 protein was carried out with an immunoperoxidase assay on 12 vulvar carcinomas and 6 VINs. Seven invasive cancers and four VINs were screened for the presence of homology to HPV 16 DNA and HSV 2 DNA transforming sequences with Southern blot hybridization. We used specimens from labial tumors and from normal vulvas and cervixes as controls. The preliminary results showed that one vulvar carcinoma and two VINs contained HPV 16 DNA. Four vulvar carcinomas expressed the E6 protein  while all the VINs were negative. Homology to HSV 2 DNA transforming sequences was detected in one vulvar cancer but not in any VIN cases. Positivity to HSV 2 ICSP 11 12 was observed in 33.3  of VIN cases and 75  of invasive cancers. HSV 2 LA1 antigenic determinant was expressed in 33.3  of VIN and 66.6  of cancer cases.

Recurrent stenosis of the carotid arteries after a carotid endarterectomy for atherosclerosis can occur as a result of myointimal hyperplasia. This condition was treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Excellent dilatation of the vessel lumen was documented after balloon dilatation. A 6-month follow-up angiographic study  however  demonstrated recurrent high-grade stenosis at the same level in both carotid arteries. Presumably  the failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and the treatment of myointimal hyperplasia of the internal carotid artery results in the same condition after the original endarterectomy  that is  additional myointimal hyperplasia.

Seventeen cases were collected in which the patient presented with a medial cheek or nasolabial fold mass. Most of these lesions were uncommon  and some were rare. The most reliable differentiating finding was the type of associated bone involvement. The malignancies had bone erosion and as a group could be distinguished from the other masses. Computed tomographic attenuation and magnetic resonance imaging signal intensities were nonspecific and did not allow a definitive diagnosis to be made. The types of pathologic conditions and their sectional imaging findings are reviewed. Som PM  Norton KI.Diagnosis of Lyme disease based on dermatologic manifestations. Lyme disease  or Lyme borreliosis  is an infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi  which is most commonly transmitted to humans by a tick bite. Characterized by early and late phases  Lyme disease is a multisystem illness involving the skin  heart  joints  and nervous system. Diagnosis is based predominantly on clinical manifestations  the most specific being dermatologic. Thus  recognizing the dermatologic manifestations of Lyme disease is important for diagnosis and institution of appropriate  effective therapy. Approximately 75  of patients with Lyme disease present with the pathognomonic skin lesion erythema migrans  an expanding erythematous lesion. During early infection  secondary erythema migrans lesions or Borrelia lymphocytoma may occur. Borrelia lymphocytoma commonly presents as an erythematous nodule on the ear lobe or nipple. During late infection  acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans  an erythematous  atrophic plaque unique to Lyme disease may appear  it has been described in about 10  of patients with Lyme disease in Europe. Fibrotic nodules associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans as well as other sclerotic and atrophic lesions  such as morphea  lichen sclerosus et atrophicus  anetoderma  and atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini  have been seen late in the course of Lyme disease. In a few cases  other sclerodermatous lesions  such as eosinophilic fasciitis and progressive facial hemiatrophy  have been linked to B. burgdorferi infection. We review the cutaneous lesions associated with Lyme disease.

Independent of the direction of perfusion  radioactivity was accumulated in a small perivenous liver parenchymal cell population  which surrounded the terminal hepatic venules as a layer of about two to five cells thick. In contrast  accumulation of radioactivity in periportal hepatocytes was low and sometimes not detectable. This distribution pattern roughly resembled that described for the immunohistochemical distribution of glutamine synthetase in liver. The present histoautoradiographic findings demonstrate a predominant uptake of vascular glutamate  aspartate and ketoglutarate into a small perivenous cell population. They confirm previous label incorporation studies in the metabolically intact liver  demonstrating an almost exclusive uptake of vascular glutamate and alpha-ketoglutarate into perivenous glutamine synthetase containing hepatocytes. In addition  evidence is presented suggesting that perivenous uptake of alpha-ketoglutarate may be one determinant for hepatic glutamine synthesis  at least under the experimental conditions used here.

Less than 20 percent of elderly and other high-risk persons targeted for annual influenza vaccination are immunized each year. In most busy practice settings  it is difficult for primary care physicians to identify every patient in need of preventive health interventions. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of microcomputer-generated reminders on influenza vaccination rates in a university-based family practice center. The practice uses an interactive encounter form system from which updated clinical information is routinely entered into a cumulative database. During a 2-month period  686 patients were identified in the database as eligible to receive influenza vaccine according to accepted criteria. Practice physicians  n   32  were stratified by level of training and randomized to one of three groups  thereby receiving printed reminders on the encounter forms of all  none  or half of their eligible patients. Patients of physicians who always received reminders were more likely to receive influenza vaccine during the study period than patients of the never-reminded physicians  51 percent versus 30 percent  P less than 0.001 . Patients whose physicians received reminders for only half their patients had an intermediate likelihood of receiving a vaccination if a reminder was printed  38 percent  but were less likely than the patients of never-reminded physicians to receive the vaccine if no reminder was printed  20 percent  P less than 0.001 . This study suggests that physicians learn to depend on reminders for preventive health activities and that reminders are most effective when they are provided at every patient encounter.

We describe a self-contained system for the continuous infusion of drugs into the rat urinary bladder. A reversible model of hydronephrosis is used to prepare one renal unit for nephrostomy tube placement. An 0.8 mm. silastic nephrostomy tube is introduced into the hydronephrotic kidney via a 16 gauge angiocath. The nephrostomy tube is then connected to an Alzet mini osmotic pump which is implanted in a subcutaneous location. The ability of this system to deliver a continuous dose of a test agent into the bladder was evaluated. Pumps were filled with a 1  solution of methylene blue in phosphate buffered saline. Following pump implantation  urinary samples were collected on a daily basis and subsequently analyzed for their concentration of methylene blue. At the completion of the experiment  specimens of the kidney  ureter  and bladder were histologically examined. Results demonstrated an average of 102  recovery of the theoretically delivered dose over a 14-day period. Renal histology demonstrated chronic inflammatory changes at the site of nephrostomy tube placement. No upper or lower tract urothelial changes were identified. This model provides a system for the continuous delivery of drugs in the rat urinary tract and results in no histological alteration to the lower urinary tract.

The recognition of such diverse aetiology may be importance since clinical features are non-specific  and may consist only of raised intracranial pressure  allowing confusion with  benign intracranial hypertension . The existence of effective treatment both for the thrombosis and for many of the underlying disorders makes early diagnosis essential. The prognosis of treated patients may be favourable.

The plasma urea creatinine ratio  U C ratio  is known to be elevated in cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Almost all patients with haematemesis have upper gastrointestinal  or generalized  bleeding so that in this study we characterized the diagnostic power of the U C ratio in patients with stools containing altered blood without haematemesis in the hope that this simple laboratory test  used in conjunction  perhaps  with clinical data  might reduce the number of patients subjected to an unrewarding gastroscopy or colonoscopy. Of 76 cases seen in a provincial and a metropolitan hospital  42 and 34 patients had upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding  respectively. Fifty-four per cent of those with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and none of those with lower gastrointestinal bleeding had U C ratios above 110 on admission. However  a discriminating level of 90 is considered to be more suitable  judged by the quadratic uncertainty score. At this level the odds for upper gastrointestinal bleeding were 15 1. Olsen LH  Andreassen KH.Ethanol inhibits luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone release from the median eminence of prepubertal female rats in vitro  investigation of its actions on norepinephrine and prostaglandin-E2. Recently  we have provided evidence that suggests that ethanol  ETOH  acts at the hypothalamic level to cause depressed serum LH levels and delay the onset of puberty in the female rat  however  the mechanism of this action is unknown. Thus  we evaluated the in vitro effects of ETOH on basal and stimulated LHRH and prostaglandin E2  PGE2  secretion from the median eminence  ME  of prepubertal female rats. Brains were removed  and MEs dissected under a stereomicroscope  rinsed  and preincubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate glucose buffer in an atmosphere of 95  O2-5  CO2 for 15 min. These media were discarded  and individual MEs were subjected to one of the following three experiments. In the first experiment  all MEs were incubated for 30 min in medium only. The media were collected and replaced in the control vials  again with medium only  or in the test vials with medium containing ETOH in doses from 15-70 mM. After this 60-min incubation  the media again were collected  then replaced with the respective control or test medium  each containing norepinephrine  NE  60 microM . Another experiment was conducted as described above  except that the MEs were challenged with PGE2  2.8 microM  in place of NE. In both experiments the amount of LHRH released into these media was measured by RIA. In a third experiment  NE was used for the challenge  however  this time the amount of PGE2 released was measured by RIA. Our results indicate that ETOH did not alter basal LHRH release but  compared with controls  significantly blocked NE-induced LHRH release in a dose-related manner. Conversely  ETOH had no effect on the PGE2-induced release of LHRH. Additionally  ETOH did not alter basal PGE2 release  however  it significantly blocked the NE-induced release of PGE2. We know that stimulation of LHRH release by NE is mediated by PGE2. Thus  these results suggest that the inhibitory effect of ETOH on LH release in the prepubertal female rat is due  at least in part  to the diminished secretion of LHRH resulting from altered PGE2 release from within the ME.

A randomized  prospective trial of patient-controlled analgesia  PCA   that is  a method of analgesia administration involving a computer-driven pump activated by patients to receive small doses within defined limits was performed in 82 children and adolescents after major orthopedic surgery to compare  1  intramuscularly administered morphine   2  PCA morphine and  3  PCA morphine with a low-dose continuous morphine infusion  PCA-plus . Patients receiving PCA and PCA-plus had lower pain scores and greater satisfaction than patients receiving intramuscularly administered morphine. The three groups used equal amounts of morphine and most measures of recovery were identical in the groups. In particular  PCA and PCA-plus did not increase the incidence of opioid-related complications  and patients receiving PCA-plus were less sedated than patients receiving intramuscular therapy. We conclude that PCA and PCA-plus are safe and effective methods of pain relief in children and adolescents after orthopedic surgery  are better accepted than intramuscular injections  and do not increase perioperative morbidity.

The major heat shock protein hsp70 is synthesized by cells of a wide variety of organisms in response to heat shock or other environmental stresses and is assumed to play an important role in protecting cells from thermal stress. We have tested this hypothesis directly by transfecting a constitutively expressed recombinant human hsp70-encoding gene into rat fibroblasts and examining the relationship between the levels of human hsp70 expressed and thermal resistance of the stably transfected rat cells. Successful transfection and expression of the gene for human hsp70 were characterized by RNA hybridization analysis  two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  and immunoblot analysis. When individual cloned cell lines were exposed to 45 degrees C and their thermal survivals were determined by colony-formation assay  we found that the expression of human hsp70 conferred heat resistance to the rat cells. These results reinforce the hypothesis that hsp70 has a protective function against thermal stress.

Enhancement of somatosensory evoked potentials by etomidate has been reported in recent clinical studies. This investigation was designed to investigate the central nervous system site of action responsible for this effect. Six adult cats were anesthetized with halothane  0.8-1   in a mixture of 50  N2O in O2. A recording electrode was placed stereotactically in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of thalamus  VPL   and a ball electrode was placed over the surface of the hind limb region of primary sensory cortex. Somatosensory evoked potentials in response to stimulation of tibial nerve thus were simultaneously recorded from cerebral cortex and VPL. The effect of two doses  1 and 3 mg.kg-1  of etomidate given 2 h apart on the latency and amplitude of cortical  positive wave at 15 ms  and thalamic  positive deflection at 10 ms  followed by negative deflection at 17 ms  evoked potentials was studied. There was no significant effect of etomidate on either latency or amplitude of early  positive thalamic potentials. Both doses of etomidate caused a significant increase in the latency and amplitude of cortical potentials. The mean latency of cortical potential increased by 1.72 ms  11   after the 1 mg.kg-1 dose and 2.3 ms  15.9   after the 3 mg.kg-1 dose. The maximum mean increase in the amplitude of cortical potentials was 14.3 microV  mean increase 78   range 28-241   after 1 mg.kg-1 and 19.1 microV  mean increase 112   range 28-202   after 3 mg.kg-1. Cortical amplitude remained significantly elevated for 30 min after 1 mg.kg-1 and for the remainder of the study period  60 min  after 3 mg.kg-1.

Emergency physicians frequently face death  yet many are unprepared to deal with the family survivors of a patient who has died unexpectedly. Without the benefit of establishing prior rapport with the family  the emergency physician must anticipate the family s grief response so that he or she can intervene to avoid an unnecessarily prolonged or morbid grief reaction. Factors predisposing to a pathologic grief response in the death of a spouse or of an infant or child must be recognized  and the physician s power to assuage survivor guilt should be used. Certain key actions in the process of notifying survivors  viewing the body  concluding the emergency department visit  and following up after the patient s death help facilitate survivor grief in the least traumatic way possible. Emergency Departments can improve their dealing with death by instituting a team approach using doctors  nurses  social workers  and clergy to better support family members in their emergency department experience and to provide a link with community service organizations helpful to the family after they leave the hospital.

We report a 43-year-old woman who presented with a right frontoparietotemporal ischemic stroke. She had been diagnosed with Turner s syndrome during childhood and had a history of chronic estrogen therapy. Cerebral angiography showed lesions characteristics of fibromuscular dysplasia involving the right internal carotid and right vertebral arteries. We are not aware of any previous reports describing an association between fibromuscular dysplasia and Turner s syndrome. Although chronic estrogen therapy cannot be ruled out as a cause of this patient s stroke  we suggest a possible etiologic relation between these two entities.

Sun-induced freckles are a risk factor for epidermal and melanocytic neoplasia. Whereas sun-induced freckles in children and older adults may be clinically indistinguishable  and sun-induced freckles in older adults usually consist of increased numbers of intraepidermal melanocytes  the histology of sun-induced freckles in children remains unsettled. Using L-3 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine  DOPA -paraffin sections  the authors examined six sun-induced freckles and adjacent nonpigmented skin  ANP  in as many white male subjects  ages 10 to 23 years. Melanocyte frequency was expressed as the ratio of DOPA-reactive melanocytes to total epidermal basal unit cells. For each case  melanocyte frequencies in freckles were significantly greater than in ANP. Cellular atypia of melanocytes was noticed in four of six freckles. Reactivity of melanocytes for HMB-45 was noticed in two freckles studied  compared with no reactivity in three specimens of ANP studied. The authors conclude the sun-induced freckles in the young may consist of a hyperplasia of melanocytes  i.e.  similar to solar lentigines in the elderly   sometimes with cellular atypia  and that these findings may be relevant to melanocytic neoplasia. Rhodes AR  Albert LS  Barnhill RL  Weinstock MA.Testosterone regulates pro-opiomelanocortin gene expression in the primate brain. Endogenous opioid peptides such as beta-endorphin  derived from proopiomelanocortin  POMC   have been widely implicated as serving an important role in the neuroendocrine regulation of the primate reproductive axis. In both human and nonhuman primates  POMC neurons are thought to mediate  at least in part  the negative feedback action of sex steroids on GnRH. Sex steroids  such as testosterone  are thought to inhibit GnRH secretion by enhancing the inhibitory activity of beta-endorphin  however  the cellular mechanisms by which steroid hormones regulate the activity of POMC neurons in the primate brain are unknown. In this study  we tested the hypothesis that testosterone stimulates POMC gene expression within the primate brain and that this regulation occurs within a specific subset of POMC neurons residing in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. We used in situ hybridization to compare cellular levels of POMC messenger RNA in intact  n   4   castrated  n   4   and castrated testosterone-treated  n   4  monkeys. We report that after castration of the male macaque  Macaca fascicularis   cellular POMC messenger RNA levels decline significantly  P less than 0.05  in neurons within the arcuate nucleus and that this decline is prevented by replacement with physiological doses of testosterone. Moreover  we found that this testosterone-dependent modulation of POMC gene expression is restricted to a small fraction of the numerous POMC neurons located within the most anterior region of the arcuate nucleus in the brain of this primate species. These observations provide evidence that sex steroids regulate expression of the POMC gene in the primate brain.

Insulin-like growth factor I  IGF-I  receptors were characterized in membranes obtained from prostate tissue of patients affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia  BPH  before and after treatment with a GnRH agonist analog. Binding of  125I IGF-I to membranes obtained from untreated patients was specific and time and temperature dependent. Analysis of the binding data yielded two classes of binding sites  one of high affinity  Kd  10 -11  mol L  and one of lower affinity  Kd  10 -9  mol L . BPH membrane preparations were affinity-cross linked to labeled IGF-I  and then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis by autoradiography revealed one labeled protein with an apparent Mr   300K under nonreducing conditions and two labeled protein with Mr   270K and Mr   130K under reducing conditions. Excess unlabeled IGF-II reduce both of them  whereas the same excess of IGF-I completely abolished them. In membrane preparations of prostatic tissues from patients affected by BPH and treated for 2 months with a GnRH agonist analog  the binding capacities of both binding sites were significantly higher than those of BPH tissue from untreated patients  whereas binding affinities were unchanged. The IGF-I receptor in BPH prostate tissue of untreated patients was mainly localized in the basal layer of the epithelium  as demonstrated by immunohistochemical staining  whereas in the tissue from treated patients positive staining was found also in the glandular epithelium. These results demonstrate that  1  specific binding sites for IGF-I are present in prostatic tissue from patients with BPH  2  androgen deprivation increases their binding capacities and seems to modify their epithelial localization.

Loss of a conceptus early in development can be detected by very sensitive assays specific for hCG. We examined 20 menstrual cycles ending in early loss of a conceptus in order to identify hormonal correlates of loss. Each loss cycle was compared to a successful conception cycle in the same woman  using daily concentration of urinary estrone-3-glucuronide and pregnanediol-3-glucuronide  PdG . The estrone-3-glucuronide and PdG profiles in cycles of early pregnancy loss were very similar to those in successful conception cycles until late in the luteal phase. Early pregnancy loss was not related to a midluteal deficiency in PdG. hCG tended to be detected later in cycles of early pregnancy loss than in successful conception cycles  presumably indicating later implantation. Ten of the early pregnancy losses implanted after luteal-day-10  only one of the successful pregnancies implanted that late. The corpus luteum responded to the conception in only 2 of the 10 loss cycles with late implantation. In contrast  the corpus luteum responded in 8 of 10 loss cycles with normally timed implantation. The similarity of preimplantation hormonal profiles in cycles of early pregnancy loss and in cycles with successful conceptions suggests that most early losses in reproductively normal women do not result directly from deficiencies in ovarian steroid production.

Detection of nitrosamine production with different bacterial genera in chronic urinary tract infections of rats. Various agents have been implicated in inducing urothelial cancer. Although drugs  occupational and environmental carcinogens are more widely accepted as playing a major role as urothelial carcinogens  several investigations suggest that bacteria may play a role. The mechanism of how bacteria may interact with the host to augment the development of urothelial carcinoma is not well understood. Clinically  investigators have linked the development of infection  urinary stones and indwelling catheters with urothelial cancer. Other investigators have suggested that the mechanism may be related to the production of carcinogenic compounds  nitrosamines  which can be detected during urinary tract infection. In our laboratory  we showed that rats with chronic urinary tract infections produced increasing urinary levels of N N dimethylnitrosamine over a 24 week period and that the production correlated with hyperplasia and early neoplasia of the bladder epithelium. Three bacterial genera were used and two of these  Escherichia coli and a protein sp.  showed production of increasing levels of urinary nitrosamine and correlated with infection. The purpose of this current study is to determine if other bacterial genera and strains can also produce similar increasing nitrosamine levels in the rat model of chronic urinary tract infection and thus provide evidence that a number of bacterial genera and strains can produce nitrosamines in vivo. Also  the histology of the chronically infected bladder was examined for hyperplasia and neoplasia.

The modulation of K  channels by serotonin  5-HT  receptors was studied by coinjecting Xenopus oocytes with mRNA transcribed in vitro from a cloned 5-HT 1C subtype  5-HT1C  receptor gene  together with size-fractionated mRNA isolated from rat cerebral cortex that expresses K  channels. After intracellular loading with EGTA to block Ca2   -dependent chloride currents  these oocytes responded to 5-HT with an inward current associated with a decrease in membrane conductance. Membrane current responses were small or absent in oocytes injected with either mRNA alone. We conclude that 5-HT1C receptors are able to cause the closing of a class of K  channels expressed by cortex mRNA in a Ca2   -independent manner. The coupling between the receptors and channels appears to be mediated by the inositol phospholipid second messenger pathway  since activation of this pathway by application of serum evoked a similar closing current.

A novel intrahepatic biliary cell culture in vivo transplantation system has been developed with an essentially pure population of bile ductular epithelial cells isolated from rat liver 6-12 weeks after bile duct ligation. In primary culture  these cells retain staining strongly for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and glutathione S-transferase P. The cytoplasm of cultured bile ductular cells reacts with an anti-laminin antibody  but loses immunoreactivity with a monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody. Semiconservative DNA synthesis in the cultured cells was dependent upon the continued presence of 10  fetal calf serum in the medium. Replicating bile ductular cells could be subcultured for a finite number of passages. In addition  freshly isolated bile ductular epithelial cells gave rise to well differentiated bile ductular structures when transplanted into the interscapular fat pads of syngeneic recipient rats.

Sufficient data are available to recommend the use of the high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiogram in patients recovering from myocardial infarction without bundle branch block to help determine their risk for developing sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However  no data are available about the extent to which pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions in patients with late potentials have an impact on the incidence of sudden cardiac death. Therefore  controlled  prospective studies are required before this issue can be resolved. As refinements in techniques evolve  it is anticipated that the clinical value of high-resolution or signal-averaged electrocardiography will continue to increase.

The effect of surgical trauma on the regulation of lipolysis was studied in isolated fat cells obtained before and 24 hours after elective cholecystectomy in 12 patients who were not obese and who were healthy otherwise. Surgery was accompanied by a twofold increase of the basal rate of lipolysis and by a significant 50  elevation of the lipolytic effect of catecholamines. The actions of various agents that selectively stimulate lipolysis at different early or late steps in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate system beyond the adrenoreceptors were also increased about 50  after surgery  p less than 0.01 . The properties of the beta-adrenoceptors were not altered by surgery  as assessed by radioligand binding and isoprenaline sensitivity. The antilipolytic properties of catecholamines  mediated by alpha 2-adrenoreceptors  were not influenced by cholecystectomy. Lipolysis was not altered in four subjects who had no surgery and who served as control subjects 24 hours after being given the same type of postoperative nutrition as patients who underwent cholecystectomy. We concluded that moderate surgical trauma is associated with increased lipolytic activity of fat cells. This is secondary to an enhanced ability of catecholamines to stimulate lipolysis because of a modification at the most distal steps in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate system  which may involve the protein kinase hormone sensitive lipase complex.

Escherichia coli hemolysin  a transmembrane pore-forming exotoxin  is considered an important virulence factor. In the present study  the possible significance of hemolysin production was investigated in a model of septic lung failure through infusion of viable bacteria in isolated rabbit lungs  10 4  to 10 7  E. coli ml perfusate caused a dose- and time-dependent appearance of hemolysin  accompanied by release of potassium  thromboxane A2  and PGI2 into the perfusate. Concomitantly  marked pulmonary hypertension developed. Inhibitor studies suggested that the pressor response was predominantly mediated by pulmonary thromboxane generation. Administration of hemolysin-forming E. coli additionally caused a protracted  dose-dependent increase in the lung capillary filtration coefficient  followed by severe edema formation. The permeability increase was independent of lung prostanoid generation. An E. coli strain that releases an inactive form of hemolysin completely failed to provoke the described biophysical and biochemical responses. Preapplication of 2 x 10 8  human granulocytes was without effect in the present experimental model. We conclude that the hemolysin produced by low numbers of E. coli organisms can provoke thromboxane-mediated pulmonary hypertension and severe vascular leakage. E. coli hemolysin and  possibly  other related cytolysins may thus contribute directly to the pathogenesis of acute respiratory failure under conditions of sepsis or pneumonia.

Psychological correlates of cardiovascular arousal and abnormal cardiac responses. The psychophysiological responses to two mental stress tests  mental arithmetic and an interactive concentration task  were assessed in 168 unmedicated  male  postinfarction patients 36-69 years old. Patients also completed a standard battery of psychological tests. Psychophysiological responses were generally unrelated to age and education. Comparison of patients scoring high  more than 75   and low  less than 25   relative to the normal population on psychological measures indicated that heart rate and blood pressure responses to mental stress tests were significantly greater in those reporting low than in those reporting high neuroticism. The study population was subsequently divided into high  medium  and low cardiovascular responders on the basis of rate-pressure product reactions to the two stress tests. The three cardiovascular response groups did not differ in age  interval between myocardial infarction and stress testing  ejection fraction  incidence of exercise-induced ischemia  or ischemic signs during Holter monitoring. However  the high cardiovascular responders were more likely to manifest possible or definite electrocardiographic signs of ischemia or significant arrhythmia during mental stress testing than were the medium or low cardiovascular responders  50  versus 19.6  and 7   respectively . High cardiovascular responders also reported lower levels of trait anxiety  neuroticism  psychophysiological symptoms  and depression.

On surgical exploration  the mass was found extending from the thyroid gland and was identified as benign thyroid tissue. Thyroid hyperplasia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Godwin JE  Miller KS  Hoang KG  Sahn SA.11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency in hyperandrogenism. OBJECTIVE  to determine the 11-deoxycortisol  S  response and incidence of 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency in hyperandrogenism. DESIGN  Hyperandrogenic women prospectively and consecutively underwent acute adrenal stimulation studies. SETTING  Tertiary institution. PATIENTS  Two hundred sixty women complaining of hirsutism and or hyperandrogenic oligomenorrhea were studied  excluding five unrelated families  1.9  of total  suffering from 21-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. Forty-one healthy premenopausal eumenorrheic women served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Only two unrelated women  0.8   had a poststimulation or net increment S level value greater than or equal to threefold the upper 95th percentile of controls and were presumed to suffer from 11 beta-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. One hundred nine  42   of hyperandrogenic women had at least one S value above the 95th percentile of controls. These women also demonstrated higher basal  F0  and stimulated cortisol levels  but a similar increment compared with controls. RESULTS  Patients with high S measures had higher testosterone  dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate  and androstenedione levels  but similar luteinizing hormone follicle-stimulating hormone ratios  than hyperandrogenic cohorts with no abnormal S measures. Basal values of S  S0   F0  or S0 F0 were not useful to predict an abnormal S response to stimulation. CONCLUSIONS  Although adrenocortical hyperactivity was present in 42  of our hyperandrogenic patients  only 0.8  were presumed to suffer from 11 beta-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. A systemic search for this deficiency in hyperandrogenism is probably unwarranted.

Angiopeptin  a novel synthetic octapeptide  was evaluated as a new approach toward the inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. Male New Zealand white rabbits  n   22  underwent carotid artery interposition bypass grafting with autologous reversed jugular vein. Nine rabbits were in the treatment group  and 13 were in the control group. The treatment group received angiopeptin 20 micrograms kg day by subcutaneous injection beginning 1 day before operation and continuing for 3 weeks until they were killed. At death the vein grafts were fixed in situ with 10  buffered formalyn at 80 mm Hg perfusion pressure. Histologic sections through each vein graft were analyzed by computerized morphometric analysis for area of neointimal hyperplasia  mm2 . Neointimal hyperplasia in the control animals was 0.080   0.017 mm2  mean   SEM   whereas neointimal hyperplasia in the group treated with angiopeptin was 0.022   0.006 mm2  mean   SEM   p   0.02 . This is the first time that peptide inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia has been demonstrated in vein grafts and may have significant implications for future use in vascular surgery.

The association of some cases of endometrial carcinoma  EC  with hyperestrogenism is well known. The prognostic significance of concomitant endometrial hyperplasia  EH  in EC were evaluated in 142 patients with clinical stage I EC in whom lymph node assessment was carried out in 121 patients. The presence of EH was significantly associated with better differentiated tumor having lesser degrees of myometrial invasion  low segment-adnexal-lymphovascular space and pelvic para-aortic lymph node involvement. However  the presence of EH was not significantly associated with the less virulent histologic subtypes. The possible existence of two types of EC--a hormonal-dependent EC associated with EH  and an independent EC not associated with EH--is discussed and the prognostic significance of concomitant EH stressed.

A transsphenoidal biopsy established the diagnosis in both cases. Neither the involvement of the cavernous sinus nor permanent diabetes insipidus has been reported previously. A review of the literature is provided. Nussbaum CE  Okawara SH  Jacobs LS.Spiral calcium wave propagation and annihilation in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Intracellular calcium  Ca2   is a ubiquitous second messenger. Information is encoded in the magnitude  frequency  and spatial organization of changes in the concentration of cytosolic free Ca2 . Regenerative spiral waves of release of free Ca2  were observed by confocal microscopy in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. This pattern of Ca2  activity is characteristic of an intracellular milieu that behaves as a regenerative excitable medium. The minimal critical radius for propagation of focal Ca2  waves  10.4 micrometers  and the effective diffusion constant for the excitation signal  2.3 x 10 -6  square centimeters per second  were estimated from measurements of velocity and curvature of circular wavefronts expanding from foci. By modeling Ca2  release with cellular automata  the absolute refractory period for Ca2  stores  4.7 seconds  was determined. Other phenomena expected of an excitable medium  such as wave propagation of undiminished amplitude and annihilation of colliding wavefronts  were observed.

Cultured human vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells express interleukin-1  IL-1  genes when exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharides  LPS  and a variety of inflammatory mediators. Local production of IL-1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of various vascular diseases. Therefore the ability of intact vascular tissue to accumulate IL-1 mRNA and synthesize de novo biologically active IL-1 protein was examined. Escherichia coli LPS  10 micrograms kg  was administered intravenously to adult rabbits and total RNA was isolated from aortic tissue at various times after LPS injection. In saline-injected rabbits  RNA extracted from the thoracic aorta contained little or no IL-1 message detected by Northern analysis using IL-1 alpha and beta cDNA probes cloned from an LPS-stimulated rabbit splenic macrophage library. Lipopolysaccharide treatment promptly induced transient accumulation of mRNA for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta within the aorta  maximal 1-hour after injection . Short-term organoid cultures of rabbit aorta exposed to LPS in vitro synthesized immunoprecipitable IL-1 alpha protein. Extracts of aortic tissue excised 1.5 to 3.0 hours after intravenous LPS administration contained immunoreactive and biologically active IL-1 alpha. Anti-rabbit IL-1 alpha antibody neutralized the biologic activity  more than 90  . Microscopic and immunohistochemical studies did not disclose adherent or infiltrating macrophages in rabbit aorta at the time of maximal IL-1 mRNA accumulation after LPS administration  1.5 hours   indicating that intrinsic vascular wall cells rather than mononuclear phagocytes probably account for the IL-1 activity induced by LPS. In addition  aortic tissue from rabbits fed an atherogenic diet showed an enhanced ability to accumulate IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA and produce immunodetectable protein in response to LPS administration. These studies demonstrate inducible IL-1 gene expression in rabbit vascular tissue in vivo and support a local role for this cytokine in vascular pathophysiology.

AKR mice develop hyperplasia of the thymus before the development of retrovirus-associated lymphoma at that site. This hyperplasia  first detectable in AKR J mice by 4 weeks of age and in AKR C mice by 4 to 5 months of age  is characterized by an enlarged thymic medulla that contains T and B lymphocytes. In contrast to the general population of thymocytes  most of these T and B lymphocytes have a mature immunophenotype that includes expression of high levels of the MEL-14-defined  gp90   homing receptor  for peripheral lymph node high endothelial venules. In vivo homing studies reveal a marked increase in traffic of peripheral lymphocytes  T more than B  to the hyperplastic thymuses of old AKR mice as compared to histologically normal thymuses of age-matched BALB c and C57BL Ka mice or young AKR mice. These changes correlate chronologically with changes in retrovirus antigen expression in AKR thymuses and suggest a role for the traffic of lymphocytes from the periphery to the thymus in response to local antigenic stimulation in the pathogenesis of thymic hyperplasia in AKR mice. Michie SA  Rouse RV.Coexpression of galanin and adrenocorticotropic hormone in human pituitary and pituitary adenomas. Galanin is a neuropeptide that regulates the secretion of several pituitary hormones  including prolactin  PRL  and growth hormone  GH . Galaninlike immunoreactivity  Gal-IR  and galanin mRNA in the rat anterior pituitary is cell lineage specific  with predominant expression in lactotrophs and somatotrophs. The authors examined the cellular distribution of human Gal-IR in seven normal postmortem pituitaries and 62 pituitary tumors by immunoperoxidase staining. In contrast to the rat  Gal-IR in human anterior pituitaries was present in corticotrophs scattered throughout the gland  but not in lactotrophs  somatotrophs  thyrotrophs  or gonadotrophs. Distinct Gal-IR also was present in hyperplastic and neoplastic corticotrophs in 19 of 22 patients with Cushing s disease. In noncorticotroph cell tumors  unequivocal Gal-IR was present in 5 of 11 GH-secreting tumors associated with clinical acromegaly  9 of 18 nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas  and 2 of 14 prolactinomas. Of these galanin-positive tumors  four of the five GH-secreting adenomas  six of the nine nonfunctioning adenomas  and both of the prolactinomas also contained adrenocorticotropic hormone immunoreactivity  ACTH-IR . Immunostaining and in situ hybridization on adjacent sections using an 35S-labeled probe complementary to human galanin mRNA demonstrated predominant galanin expression in normal corticotrophs. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the presence of Gal-IR in pituitary cells characteristic of corticotrophs in both normal and neoplastic pituitaries. Thus  as in the rat  galanin gene expression in the human pituitary is cell-type specific. Unlike the rat  however  human galanin gene expression is restricted to the corticotroph lineage. Studies of tumors confirmed the observed coexpression of galanin and adrenocorticotropic hormone. The divergent cell type specificity of galanin production in human and rat pituitaries reflects different patterns of gene activation in these two species. In addition  these results suggest that galanin in the human pituitary may participate locally in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

A man with multicentric angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia and a polyclonal gammopathy developed a debilitating sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy that resolved with plasma-pheresis and immunosuppressive therapy. Fourteen similar cases have been reported in the literature  however  to our knowledge  this is the first report of successful treatment with plasma-pheresis. Severe peripheral neuropathy usually occurs in the setting of multicentric  plasma cell-type disease with hypergammaglobulinemia and is often responsive to immunosuppressive therapy. Scherokman B  Vukelja SJ  May E.Late-onset elevation in intraocular pressure after neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. We retrospectively studied the long-term change in intraocular pressure after neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. Uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed in 446 consecutive normal eyes  401 patients   237  53   of which subsequently underwent uncomplicated neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. Late-onset elevation in intraocular pressure was seen in three eyes  1.4   after cataract surgery alone  mean follow-up  2.7   - 1.7 years  and in 14 eyes  5.9   after cataract and laser surgeries  mean follow-up  3.0   - 1.1 years . This difference was statistically significant  P less than .03 . These results suggest that  in addition to immediate changes in intraocular pressure  neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy may be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure long after the laser surgery  even in normal eyes without obvious postoperative complications.

BACKGROUND. Little is known about the mechanism s  in the development of restenosis after excimer laser angioplasty. Thus  the rationale of this study was to determine the time course of intimal and medial smooth muscle cell  SMC  proliferation and histomorphological changes after experimental excimer laser treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS. Laser ablation was performed in the right carotid artery of 34 New Zealand White rabbits after development of a fibromuscular plaque by repeated weak electrical stimulations. The vessels were excised 3  7  14  21  28  and 42 days after excimer laser treatment. Staining of alpha-actin was used to identify SMCs. In five rabbits  15    a stenosis of more than 50  of luminal area was due to intimal proliferation of SMCs  and in four other rabbits  a total occlusion was due to organized thrombi. After the initial ablation of the performed plaque  13   - 6 intimal SMC layers  a continuous increase of intimal wall thickness was found from 7   - 6 SMC layers at 7 days to 28   - 5 intimal SMC layers at 28 days after excimer laser ablation  p less than 0.01 . After 42 days  no additional increase of intimal thickening occurred. After bromodeoxyuridine labeling  the extent of cell proliferation  percent of cells undergoing DNA synthesis  in the intima and media was determined using a monoclonal antibody against bromodeoxyuridine. Immunohistological quantification of SMC proliferation in the intima revealed a significant increase of cells undergoing DNA synthesis at 3  p less than 0.05  and 14  p less than 0.01  days after laser treatment. Medial proliferation of SMCs was delayed and had a significant increase 7 days  p less than 0.05  after intervention. Twenty-one days after laser treatment  SMC proliferation in the intima as well as in the media was normalized. CONCLUSIONS. The proliferative response of SMCs after experimental excimer laser treatment will occur as a dynamic process with a maximum of SMCs undergoing DNA synthesis during 14 days after laser ablation  resulting in an increase of intimal thickening within 4 weeks after laser treatment. The extent of intimal hyperplasia due to SMC proliferation after excimer laser treatment is comparable with the effect of transluminal balloon angioplasty in this experimental model. Hanke H  Haase KK  Hanke S  Oberhoff M  Hassenstein S  Betz E  Karsch KR.Abnormal cardiovascular reactivity in borderline and mild essential hypertension. Cardiovascular and hemodynamic reactivity was evaluated with M-mode echocardiography  phonocardiography  and carotidography in correlation with circulating catecholamine levels in 25 normotensive subjects  15 borderline hypertensive patients  and 42 mildly hypertensive patients during isometric exercise at 30  of the maximum force for 3 minutes. At rest  norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were significantly higher  and the cardiac index was similarly increased in both groups of hypertensive patients  but the cardiac mass index was significantly increased only in the mildly hypertensive group. During isometric exercise  the sympathoadrenal reactivity as well as the pressor and chronotropic responses were similar in normotensive subjects and both groups of hypertensive patients. However  the variations in blood pressure were achieved through totally different hemodynamic mechanisms in normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients. In normotensive subjects  the increase in blood pressure could be linked mainly to an increase in cardiac contractility and performance  whereas in either group of hypertensive patients  the increase in blood pressure was mainly associated with an increase in peripheral resistance. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis of a blunted beta-adrenergic reactivity and a predominance of alpha-adrenergic vascular reactivity in borderline and mildly hypertensive patients. This phenomenon  which appears to be unrelated to age or severity of hypertension  could be an important mechanism underlying the development of hypertension in humans. de Champlain J  Petrovich M  Gonzalez M  Lebeau R  Nadeau R.Decreased measles antibody response after measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in infants with colds  see comments  We examined the possibility that the common cold or afebrile upper respiratory tract infection might interfere with successful immunization in children who receive standard measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Infants 15 to 18 months of age presenting at our well-child clinics for routine examination and immunizations were divided into two groups. Those infants with a history and physical findings of upper respiratory tract infection were compared with healthy control group infants who did not have upper respiratory tract infections  and who did not have a history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms within the previous month. Both groups were studied for their serologic response to measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Prevaccination serum samples were obtained prior to vaccine administration and postvaccination serum samples were obtained 6 to 8 weeks later. Measles antibody was measured in these serum samples by an indirect fluorescein-tagged antibody test. Ten  21   of 47 infants with colds failed to develop measles antibody  while only one  2   of 51 well infants failed to develop antibody. We conclude that infants with colds have a significant seroconversion failure rate associated with measles vaccine administration and that this may be the cause of some primary measles vaccine failures. Krober MS  Stracener CE  Bass JW.Results of treatment of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. The records of 48 patients with persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous  PHPV  were reviewed. Approximately 17  had vision of 20 100 or better after surgery  contact lens fitting  and amblyopia therapy. Only eyes with a purely anterior presentation had successful visual outcomes. Lensectomy alone prevented glaucoma  but a membranectomy as well was required to ensure a successful visual result. Eyes with a posterior PHPV had poor visual results because of posterior pole abnormalities. I recommend that an attempt be made to visually salvage eyes with an anterior presentation. Eyes with a posterior or a combination anterior-posterior PHPV can be successfully treated for glaucoma  but the visual results will be poor.

Brunt EM  Flye MW.Dysmegakaryopoiesis resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in treated acute myeloid leukemia. Acute myeloid leukemia  AML  is characterized by trilineage dysplasia  including atypical megakaryocytes. Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia  FAB M7  is particularly associated with atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia  AMH . Fifteen patients with nonmegakaryoblastic AML developed AMH after therapy  comprising 12.6  of cases of AML diagnosed from 1986 to 1989. Platelet counts were normal in nine patients and decreased in six. Blasts comprised less than 5  of cells in 40  of the biopsies  ranged from 5-15  in 53   and comprised more than 30  of cells in 7 . Numerous small hypo- and hyperlobated megakaryocytes were seen in all specimens  often occurring in clusters  and were more easily seen in sections than in smears. Subsequent biopsies in 13 patients showed a remission marrow in seven  increased blasts in three  and AML in three  none showed AMH. AMH resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia may be seen transiently after treatment of AML. Rosenthal NS  Farhi DC.Occupational asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis from inhalation of crystalline bovine serum albumin powder. A 24-year-old white female laboratory technician developed recurrent rhinoconjunctivitis and wheezing immediately following repeated exposure to purified lyophilized bovine serum albumin  BSA . Prick and titrated intradermal skin tests revealed strongly positive results in the patient and negative results in normal controls. A titrated double-blind  placebo-controlled bronchial inhalation challenge with an aqueous BSA solution was positive at 10 mg mL. Use of an albuterol metered dose inhaler and avoidance of laboratory exposure to BSA have resulted in resolution of symptoms. These results are consistent with an IgE-mediated mechanism  and this case represents the first reported instance of occupational asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis to inhaled BSA powder. Joliat TL  Weber RW.Antibody-fluorescein conjugates for photoimmunodiagnosis of human colon carcinoma in nude mice. To improve the detectability of tumors by light-induced fluorescence  the use of monoclonal antibodies  MoAb  as carriers of fluorescent molecules was studied. As a model for this approach  the biodistribution of an anticarcinoembryonic antigen  CEA  MoAb coupled to fluorescein was studied in mice bearing a human colon carcinoma xenograft. In vitro  such conjugates with fluorescein-MoAb molar ratios ranging from four to 19  doubly labeled with 125I  showed more than 82  binding to immobilized CEA. In vivo  conjugates with a fluorescein-MoAb molar ratio of ten or less resulted in a tumor uptake of more than 30  of the injected dose of radioactivity per gram tumor at 24 hours. Tumor to liver  kidney  and muscle ratios of 20  30 and 72  respectively  were obtained 48 hours after injection of the 125I-MoAb- fluorescein 10 conjugate. The highest fluorescence intensity was always obtained for the tumor with the anti-CEA MoAb conjugate  whereas in control mice injected with fluoresceinated control immunoglobulin G1  no detectable increase in tumor fluorescence was observed. To compare these results with a classically used dye  mice bearing the same xenografts received 60 micrograms of Photofrin II. The intensity of the fluorescence signal of the tumor with this amount of Photofrin II was eight times lower than that obtained after an injection of 442 ng of fluorescein coupled with 20 micrograms of MoAb  which gave an absolute amount of fluorescein localized in the tumor of up to 125 ng g of tumor. These results illustrate the possibility of improving the specificity of in vivo tumor localization of dyes for laser-induced fluorescence photodetection and phototherapy by coupling them to MoAb directed against tumor markers. Pelegrin A  Folli S  Buchegger F  Mach JP  Wagnieres G  van den Bergh H.Stenting of coronary arteries  has a modern Pandora s box been opened  Interventional cardiology has recently witnessed the growth of several alternatives to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty  including coronary stenting. Although stenting appears to be useful in treating abrupt closure after coronary angioplasty  its effectiveness in limiting the complex processes responsible for late restenosis is much less certain. Pathologic examination of stented human saphenous bypass grafts shows extensive deposits of platelets  fibrin and leukocytes along the stent wires within the 1st week and formation of a neointima of variable thickness after 3 months without evidence of foreign body reaction. The long-term effects of continuous barotrauma induced by the expanded stent remain unknown. It is difficult to assess the relative merits of the new devices  but stenting has several theoretic advantages. It seems less disruptive to the underlying architecture of the vessel wall and enjoys favorable theoretic and effective expansion ratios. Wide-spread clinical acceptance for stenting will depend on demonstrating that its safety  efficacy and cost efficiency are superior to those of balloon angioplasty. Serruys PW  Strauss BH  van Beusekom HM  van der Giessen WJ.The role of platelets  thrombin and hyperplasia in restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Coronary angioplasty has become a successful and widely used treatment for patients with coronary artery disease since its first clinical application in 1977. The primary success rate has improved despite the increase in procedure and case complexity. However  acute reocclusion and late restenosis  which constitute the most important problems after successful angioplasty  continue to occur in about 5  and 35  of patients within 3 to 6 months  respectively. Angioscopic and pathologic observations have suggested that a multifactorial pathophysiologic process accounts for acute reocclusion  involving marked thrombosis  intimal dissection  medial and subintimal hemorrhage  vascular recoil and vasocontriction. In contrast  chronic restenosis involves the development of fibrocellular intimal hyperplasia within a milieu created by vascular injury  platelet activation  thrombin generation and the release of mitogens. Although current pharmacologic approaches  which involve antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy  have been largely ineffective in eliminating acute reocclusion and chronic restenosis  recent advances in the research in thrombosis  platelet receptors and smooth muscle growth regulation have allowed new therapeutic options to be tested in the experimental setting  with subsequent potential clinical applications in patients. Ip JH  Fuster V  Israel D  Badimon L  Badimon J  Chesebro JH.Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is exacerbated by IL-1 alpha and suppressed by soluble IL-1 receptor. To assess the role of IL-1 in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  EAE   the effects of in vivo treatment with IL-1 alpha or an IL-1 antagonist on the clinical course of EAE were evaluated. First  Lewis rats were immunized with guinea pig myelin in CFA and treated for 19 consecutive days with i.p. injections of recombinant human IL-1 alpha. Clinical signs of paralysis in the IL-1 alpha-treated groups were of longer duration and of greater severity compared to placebo injected controls. In addition  more weight loss was observed in the IL-1 alpha-treated groups compared to controls. This enhanced weight loss was not due to IL-1 alpha injections alone as CFA-treated rats injected with IL-1 alpha did not lose weight when compared to placebo injected  CFA-treated controls. Second  soluble mouse rIL-1R  sIL-1R   which binds both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta  was given as an IL-1 antagonist. Treatment of guinea pig myelin CFA immunized rats with sIL-1R for 13 consecutive days significantly delayed the onset of EAE  reduced the severity of paralysis and weight loss  and shortened the duration of disease. Treatment with sIL-1R was most effective in reducing EAE if administered for 15 consecutive days immediately after immunization. Shortened 5-day treatment regimens spanning days 1 to 5  days 6 to 10  or days 11 to 15 after immunization were less effective in reducing EAE. These data suggest that IL-1 may initiate or promote inflammation within the central nervous system. In addition  specifically blocking the biological activity of IL-1 in vivo by soluble receptors may prove beneficial for the treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.

Seven highly trained female cyclists  age 22   - 5 yr  height 165   - 6 cm  weight 60   - 5 kg  VO2max 55   - 6 ml.min-1.kg-1  mean   - SD  consumed  for 1 wk each  isocaloric diets containing varying levels of carbohydrate  protein  and fat designated as low carbohydrate  LCHO   moderate carbohydrate  MCHO   and high carbohydrate  HCHO . Diets were administered in random order  and each subject consumed all three diet treatments. At the end of each weekly diet treatment  subjects rode on a cycle ergometer at 80  VO2max until fatigued. Cyclists continued light training during the diet treatments. Following each diet treatment and immediately prior to the fatiguing cycle ergometer ride  cyclists completed a Profile of Mood States  POMS  questionnaire. The POMS yields measures of tension  T   depression  D   anger  A   vigor  V   fatigue  F   and confusion  C   as well as providing a total mood score  TMS . Results indicated that subjects on LCHO had significantly  P less than or equal to 0.05  greater T  D  A  and TMS and less V compared with MCHO and HCHO. There were no significant differences between MCHO and HCHO. In the present study  LCHO in conjunction with training and exercise adversely affected the mood state of trained female cyclists as compared with MCHO and HCHO diets.

The distally based rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap is used in a new technique for vaginal reconstruction after pelvic exenteration for malignant disease. We identified 27 patients who underwent this procedure  of whom eight had a total of 14 postoperative CT scans and two CT-directed biopsies. The myocutaneous flap appeared as a unilateral arcuate band of soft tissue extending from the linea alba to the rectal fascia or sacrum. Additional CT findings included asymmetric thinning of the ventral abdominal wall  7 8   fluid collections  2 8   vaginal breakdown  1 8   presacral soft-tissue thickening  6 8   and tumor recurrence  3 8 . The postoperative CT scan reflects the altered anatomy produced by the surgery. Complications and recurrent disease can be recognized as deviations from the normal postoperative appearance. Willing SJ  Pursell SH  Koch SR  Tobin GR.Effects of nitrous oxide on coronary pressure and regional contractile function in experimental myocardial ischemia. To determine whether nitrous oxide  N2O  worsens myocardial ischemia by diminishing coronary pressure  we performed two sets of experiments using an acutely instrumented swine model of regional coronary ischemia. In constant pressure experiments  n   11   coronary pressure and heart rate were kept constant as N2O  77 -79   was substituted for N2 in the inspired gas. Nitrous oxide decreased systolic shortening  measured by sonomicrometry  from 68.0  to 63.6   P less than 0.05  of preischemic control values in the ischemic zone and from 116.2  to 103.2   P less than 0.05  of control values in the adjacent normal myocardium. There was no disproportionate effect of N2O on ischemic myocardium  and the N2O-induced depression of contractile function was fully reversible. In a series of constant external stenosis experiments  n   13   the effects of N2O on heart rate  mean arterial pressure  and the coronary stenosis itself were not controlled. In these experiments  substitution of N2O for N2 induced deterioration in both the ischemic zone  systolic shortening decreased from 68.7  to 58.4  of preischemic control values  P less than 0.05  and in the adjacent normal myocardium  systolic shortening decreased from 113  to 102.9  of preischemic control  P less than 0.05 . Nitrous-oxide-induced ischemic zone contractile dysfunction was often not reversible. The pressure gradient across the coronary stenosis did not increase and peripheral coronary pressure did not decrease because of N2O. Diffusion hypoxia was also excluded. This study confirms that N2O has a significant but mild depressant effect on the performance of both normal and ischemic myocardium. ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS  Cason BA  Demas KA  Mazer CD  Gordon HJ  Hickey RF.Intensive sequential chemotherapy with mitoxantrone and continuous infusion etoposide and cytarabine for previously treated acute myelogenous leukemia. Intensive sequential chemotherapy with mitoxantrone  12 mg m2 d on days 1 through 3  etoposide  200 mg m2 d as a continuous infusion on days 8 through 10  and cytarabine  500 mg m2 d as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 3 and 8 through 10 was administered to 72 patients aged less than 60 years with previously treated acute myelogenous leukemia  AML . Forty patients had refractory AML  nonresponse to prior therapy  early first relapse  or multiple relapse  and 32 had late first relapse. Sixty-one percent of patients  with a 95  confidence interval  CI  ranging from 49  to 72   achieved complete remission  CR   including 45   CI  30  to 62   of refractory patients and 81   CI  64  to 93   of late first relapse patients. Twenty-nine percent of patients  CI  19  to 41   did not respond to therapy and 10   CI  4  to 19   died from therapy-related toxicity. Median duration of aplasia was 30 days. Nonhematologic WHO grade 3 or more toxicity included sepsis  57  of patients   vomiting  10    mucositis  35    diarrhea  7    skin rash  6    and hyperbilirubinemia  11  . Postinduction therapy was attempted in 36 of 44 CR patients  16 of them received a second course of the same regimen  7 received maintenance chemotherapy  4 underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation  BMT   and 9 allogeneic BMT. At a median follow-up of 20 months  23 of the 44 complete remitters have relapsed  1 to 14 months after achievement of CR  including 19 of 31 patients not undergoing BMT. Median survival is 7 months with 16   CI  4  to 28   projected survival at 47 months. Median disease-free survival is 6 months with 21   CI  3  to 39   of CR patients projected to remain disease-free at 46 months. Twenty-six percent  CI  13  to 43   of the evaluable patients who did not receive transplantation had inversion of CR duration. Among patients younger than 50 years  there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between patients receiving postinduction chemotherapy and those receiving BMT. We conclude that this chemotherapy regimen is highly efficient and could be used as first-line therapy in young patients with AML.

Hydrogen peroxide produces marked antigonadotropic and lytic actions in luteal cells  but the effects of superoxide  the archetypal oxygen radical  are unknown. Xanthine oxidase generates superoxide  and the activity of this enzyme  and purine substrate  are increased under ischemia  such as that seen at luteal regression. We therefore examined the actions of xanthine oxidase on luteal cells to assess the effects of this enzyme and the superoxide anion on luteal function. Xanthine oxidase  in the presence of hypoxanthine  50 microM   produced marked inhibition of LH-sensitive cAMP and progesterone production with complete inhibition at 25 mU ml and half-maximal inhibition at about 5 mU ml. These antigonadotropic actions of xanthine oxidase were rapid with maximal effects within 5 min  followed several minutes later by substantial depletion of ATP. Heat  superoxide dismutase  and catalase or catalase alone abolished the actions of xanthine oxidase. While depletion of ATP by xanthine oxidase was prevented by 3-amino-benzamide  an inhibitor of DNA repair  inhibition of cAMP and progesterone production was still evident. Xanthine oxidase also inhibited progesterone synthesis stimulated by 8-bromo-cAMP. Isobutylmethylxanthine  a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor  did not reverse the inhibition of cAMP accumulation by xanthine oxidase  and the enzyme had no effect on LH receptor binding activity. Since catalase reversed the effects of xanthine oxidase  we conclude that superoxide was rapidly dismuted to hydrogen peroxide and mediated the antigonadotropic and antisteroidogenic actions of xanthine oxidase in luteal cells. The sensitivity of luteal cells to xanthine oxidase raises the possibility that this enzyme may serve as a significant source of hydrogen peroxide in the corpus luteum.

During the period from August 1976 until July 1989 the transmandibular implant was introduced in a total of 31 oral and maxillofacial surgery departments in the Netherlands and 1 466 patients were treated. This study includes 1 356 treated patients from 28 departments. The treatment course of 1 201 patients  89.6   was uneventful. Of the 157 complications  58 related to the anatomic contour of the mandible  49 to the surgery  25 to the prosthetic reconstruction  8 to the psychosocial attitude of the patient  8 to the use of medication  5 to trauma  and 4 to the presence of a skin graft.

After a year of deliberation and investigation  the Pepper Commission recommended action to ensure that all Americans would have health insurance protection in an efficient  effective health care system. Because it believes that action is urgent  the commission would build universal coverage by securing  improving  and extending the combination of job-based and public coverage we now have. Reform would entail the following elements  a combination of incentives and requirements that would guarantee all workers  with their nonworking dependents  insurance coverage through their jobs  replacement of Medicaid with a new federal program that would cover all those not covered through the workplace and workers whose employers find public coverage more affordable  guaranteed affordable coverage for employers--through reform of private insurance  tax credits for small employers  and the opportunity to purchase public coverage  a minimum benefit standard for private and public plans that would cover preventive and primary services as well as catastrophic care and would include cost sharing  subject to ability to pay  and a combination of public and private sector initiatives to promote quality and contain costs. Rockefeller JD 4th.Direct molecular identification of the mouse pink-eyed unstable mutation by genome scanning. DNA sequences associated with the mouse pink-eyed unstable mutation were identified in the absence of closely linked molecular markers and without prior knowledge of the encoded gene product. This was accomplished by  genome scanning   a technique in which high-resolution Southern blots of genomic DNAs were hybridized to a dispersed and moderately repetitive DNA sequence. In this assay  pink-eyed unstable DNA was distinguished from the DNA of wild-type and revertant mice by enhanced hybridization to one of several hundred resolved fragments. The fragment showing enhanced hybridization in pink-eyed unstable DNA was cloned and found to lie within a DNA duplication that is located close to  or within  the pink-eyed dilution locus. The duplication associated with the mouse pink-eyed unstable mutation may mediate the high reversion frequency characteristic of this mutation. Brilliant MH  Gondo Y  Eicher EM.Pathologic and hemodynamic sequelae of unilobar biliary obstruction and associated liver atrophy. A patient is presented with unilobar biliary obstruction associated with marked liver atrophy and compensatory hypertrophy. Characteristically she was not jaundiced and had no portal hypertension. Quantitative measurements of the degree of hepatocyte hyperplasia showed that over 50  of cells in the hypertrophied lobe were hyperplastic. Surprisingly  a similar percentage of cells in the atrophied lobe were also hyperplastic. No difference was found in the size of hepatocytes between the two lobes or among the hepatocyte subpopulations in the atrophied lobe. The findings in this case suggest  1  lobar atrophy induces a hyperplastic response in more than one half of the cells of the contralateral lobe   2  the development of atrophy consequent on biliary obstruction is likely the result of destruction of whole cells rather than cytoplasmic loss   3  the development of a hyperplastic response within the atrophied lobe is a new finding and is consistent with the hormonal theory of hepatic regeneration  and  4  striking compensatory hypertrophy of the liver is associated with normal portal venous pressure.

BACKGROUND. Intracoronary stents may be effective when used as  bail-out  devices for acute complications after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Furthermore  preliminary reports have demonstrated some promising results with stents with regard to the reduction of restenosis. Several stent devices are available for preclinical and clinical evaluation. The use of these stainless-steel stents has been limited by poor visibility during fluoroscopy and thrombogenicity during the first days to weeks after implantation. We therefore investigated the immediate and short-term effects on arterial patency of a new  radiopaque  balloon-expandable coil stent in normal coronary arteries of pigs. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 animals  a stent was placed in two of the three epicardial coronary arteries. During the implantation procedure  the animals received heparin  after the procedure  no antithrombotic drugs were administered. After 1 week  five animals and 10 stents  or 4 weeks  five animals and 10 stents   repeat angiography was performed  followed by pressure-fixation of the coronary arteries for light and electron microscopic examination. Angiographic analysis revealed that all stented coronary segments were patent and without signs of intraluminal defects. Scanning electron microscopy showed complete endothelial covering of all stents within 7 days. Light microscopy showed a reduced tunica media locally under the stent wires  which resulted from exerted pressure. The neointima on top of the stent wires measured 56 microns  range  42-88 microns  after 1 week and 139 microns  range  84-250 microns  after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS. Results from this study show that this radiopaque endoprosthesis can be safely placed in normal coronary arteries of pigs. After 4 weeks  all stents were patent and there was no need for additional antithrombotic treatment  whereas neointimal proliferation was limited. van der Giessen WJ  Serruys PW  van Beusekom HM  van Woerkens LJ  van Loon H  Soei LK  Strauss BH  Beatt KJ  Verdouw PD.
